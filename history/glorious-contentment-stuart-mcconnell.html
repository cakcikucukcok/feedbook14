  <title>Glorious Contentment - Stuart McConnell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Grand Army of the Republic, the largest of all Union Army veterans&#39; organizations, was the most powerful single-issue political lobby of the late nineteenth century, securing massive pensions for veterans and helping to elect five postwar presidents from its own membership.  To its members, it was also a secret fraternal order, a source of local charity, a provider of entertainment in small municipalities, and a patriotic organization.  Using GAR convention proceedings, newspapers, songs, rule books, and local post records, Stuart McConnell examines this influential veterans&#39; association during the years of its greatest strength.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beginning with a close look at the men who joined the GAR in three localities -- Philadelphia;  Brockton, Massachusetts; and Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin - McConnell goes on to examine the Union veterans&#39; attitudes towards their former Confederate enemies and toward a whole range of noncombatants whom the verterans called &quot;civilians&quot;:  stay-at-home townsfolk, Mugwump penion reformers, freedmen, women, and their own sons and daughters.  In the GAR, McConnell sees a group of veterans trying to cope with questions concerning the extent of society&#39;s obligation to the poor and injured, the place of war memories in peacetime, and the meaning of the &quot;nation&quot; and the individual&#39;s relation to it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;McConnell aruges that, by the 1890s, the GAR was clinging to a preservationist version of American nationalism that many white, middle-class Northerners found congenial in the face of the social upheavals of that decade.  In effect, he concludes, the nineteenth-century career of the GAR is a study in the microcosm of a nation trying to hold fast to an older image of itself in the face of massive social change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
