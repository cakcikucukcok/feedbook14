  <title>The Mail Rider - Robert J Gossett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sam Clay ( formerly Samuel Samuelson Jr.) is banished from his fathers Paris, Kentucky tobacco farm because of holding opposite views on slavery. After he discloses his intention to enlist in the Union Army, his obstinate, opinionated father sends him away, telling him, he would be shot if he returned. With a horse and rifle borrowed from a sympathetic neighbor, he rides to Cincinnati, Ohio and enlists in an Infantry Regiment. With his Regiment he marches to Virginia and fights in several battles, before he is wounded and discharged. Following his discharge, he returns to Cincinnati, and finds a job as a guard on a wagon train bound for Natchez Mississippi. During this long, and adventure filled journey, he becomes friends with a Confederate Soldier, Cody Travis, who has escaped from a prisoner of war camp. When they arrive in Natchez, Sam accepts Codys invitation to accompany him to his home in Marfa, Texas. After all, he had no other place to go. In Marfa he finds work, first as a quicksilver guard, and later, as a mail rider.
