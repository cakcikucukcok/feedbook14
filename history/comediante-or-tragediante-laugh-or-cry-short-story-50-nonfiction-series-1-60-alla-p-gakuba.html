  <title>Comediante or Tragediante?  Laugh or Cry?: SHORT STORY # 50.  Nonfiction series #1 - # 60. - Alla P. Gakuba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Comediante or Tragediante? Laugh or Cry? &amp;mdash;in the 19th century a new form of literature and plays was born, comedy-tragedy in English. The play combines 2 great human emotions, comedy and tragedy, into one. To laugh or to cry, or do both at the same time, laughing through tears.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In 1804, Napoleon Bonaparte became the First Emperor of France. His ambition was to conquer many countries in Europe, so Europe would be united under his empire and function under the ideas of the French Revolution. Napoleon&amp;rsquo;s Empire was growing, and pressure was mounting on him to have an heir. He decided to divorce Josephine who could not produce him a heir.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Later, to divorce Josephine, Napoleon asked Pius VII to annul their marriage. Pope Pius VII was short&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;and firm; he combined his refusal into one word: &amp;ldquo;Comediante!&amp;rdquo; Napoleon threw a temper tantrum and slapped the Pope in his face. For that punch, Pius VII yielded: &amp;ldquo;Tragediante!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;An example of &amp;ldquo;Tragediente or Comediente&amp;rdquo; very much is applicable today to our government.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To American citizens&amp;rsquo; astonishment and sometimes amusement, the USA Congressmen and the Senators know only one thing&amp;mdash;how to throw money at problems. Instead of the 1st to find a real solution to a problem.&lt;/p&gt;" />
