  <title>Dissecting the Holocaust: The Growing Critique of &#39;Truth&#39; and &#39;Memory&#39; - Robert Faurisson, Carlo Mattogno, Germar Rudolf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The blockbuster anthology that struck Holocaust orthodoxy a body blow from which it has never recovered. &lt;em&gt;Dissecting&lt;/em&gt; marshals the work of more than a dozen researchers to subject the conventional historiography of the &amp;quot;gas chambers&amp;quot;, the &amp;quot;six million&amp;quot;, the postwar trials, and other linchpins of the extermination story to careful, precise, methodical, and withering analysis. Germar Rudolf on how chemical analysis gravely weakens the case for gassing in the Auschwitz-Birkenau crematoria, Carlo Mattogno and Franco Deana on the crematory ovens of Auschwitz, Robert Faurisson, Manfred K&amp;ouml;hler, and Claus Jordan on how testimony was coerced and convictions manufactured, Fritz Berg, Ingrid Weckert, Carlo Mattogno, and Arnulf Neumaier on the technical and evidentiary absurdities of gassing claims for German trucks in gas chambers and at Majdanek and Treblinka, Udo Walendy and John Ball on analysis of photos alleged to depict the crimes or their locations, Rudolf on the evidence for Jewish losses during WWII, J&amp;uuml;rgen Graf on myths about the concentration camps, and more. Dissecting&amp;#39;s handsome design and format lend themselves well to the numerous illustrations, charts, and diagrams with which these leading revisionists advance the wealth of evidence the book offers against the Holocaust myth. This is a book&amp;mdash;the book&amp;mdash;that every revisionist needs to own, and to read.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There is at present no other single volume that so provides a serious reader with a broad understanding of the contemporary state of historical issues that influential people would rather not have examined.&amp;quot; &amp;mdash;Prof. Dr. Arthur R. Butz, Evanston, IL&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There is much in the various contributions that strikes one as thoroughly convincing.&amp;quot; &amp;mdash;Historian Dr. Joachim Hoffmann, Expert Trial Report&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Read this book and you will know where revisionism is today. And the shock is that revisionism has done away with the exterminationist case.&amp;quot; &amp;mdash;Andrew Gray, &lt;em&gt;The Barnes Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;These contributions read like detective stories&amp;mdash;analyzing the evidence for several crimes in a Sherlock Holmes style.&amp;quot; &amp;mdash;The Christian News, July 24, 2000&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I envy the United States where such a book can be published without negative consequences. It will probably unleash a broad discussion.&amp;quot; &amp;mdash;Historian Prof. Dr. Ernst Nolte, Berlin, Germany&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;" />
