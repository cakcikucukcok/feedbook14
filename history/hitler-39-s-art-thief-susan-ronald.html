  <title>Hitler&#39;s Art Thief - Susan Ronald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The world was stunned when eighty-year old Cornelius Gurlitt became an international media superstar in November 2013 on the discovery of over 1,400 artworks in his 1,076 square-foot Munich apartment, valued at around $1.35 billion. Gurlitt became known as a man who never was - he didn&#39;t have a bank account, never paid tax, never received social security. He simply did not exist. He had been hard-wired into a life of shadows and secrecy by his own father long before he had inherited his art collection built on the spoliation of museums and Jews during Hitler&#39;s Third Reich. The ensuing media frenzy unleashed international calls for restitution, unsettled international relations, and rocked the art world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Susan Ronald reveals in this stranger-than-fiction-tale how Hildebrand Gurlitt succeeded in looting in the name of the Third Reich, duping the Monuments Men and the Nazis alike. As an &quot;official dealer&quot; for Hitler and Goebbels, Hildebrand Gurlitt became one of the Third Reich&#39;s most prolific art looters.  Yet he stole from Hitler too, allegedly to save modern art. &lt;i&gt;Hitler&#39;s Art Thief &lt;/i&gt;is the untold story of Hildebrand Gurlitt, who stole more than art-he stole lives, too.&lt;/p&gt;" />
