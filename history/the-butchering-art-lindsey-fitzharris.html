  <title>The Butchering Art - Lindsey Fitzharris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Winner, 2018 PEN/E.O. Wilson Prize for Literary Science Writing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Short-listed for the 2018 Wellcome Book Prize&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Top 10 Science Book of Fall 2017, &lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Best History Book of 2017, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Guardian&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Warning: She spares no detail!&quot; --Erik Larson, bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Dead Wake&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Butchering Art&lt;/i&gt;, the historian Lindsey Fitzharris reveals the shocking world of nineteenth-century surgery and shows how it was transformed by advances made in germ theory and antiseptics between 1860 and 1875. She conjures up early operating theaters--no place for the squeamish--and surgeons, who, working before anesthesia, were lauded for their speed and brute strength. These pioneers knew that the aftermath of surgery was often more dangerous than patients&#39; afflictions, and they were baffled by the persistent infections that kept mortality rates stubbornly high. At a time when surgery couldn&#39;t have been more hazardous, an unlikely figure stepped forward: a young, melancholy Quaker surgeon named Joseph Lister, who would solve the riddle and change the course of history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitzharris dramatically reconstructs Lister&#39;s career path to his audacious claim that germs were the source of all infection and could be countered by a sterilizing agent applied to wounds. She introduces us to Lister&#39;s contemporaries--some of them brilliant, some outright criminal--and leads us through the grimy schools and squalid hospitals where they learned their art, the dead houses where they studied, and the cemeteries they ransacked for cadavers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eerie and illuminating, &lt;i&gt;The Butchering Art&lt;/i&gt; celebrates the triumph of a visionary surgeon whose quest to unite science and medicine delivered us into the modern world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
