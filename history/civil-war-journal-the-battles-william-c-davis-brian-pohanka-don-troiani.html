  <title>Civil War Journal: The Battles - William C. Davis, Brian Pohanka, Don Troiani</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Of more than one thousand battles fought during the war,&quot; William  C. Davis notes, &quot;a few have risen to lasting fascination and prominence,  some even regarded as &#39;turning points.&#39; The battles included in this book are  those that caused the greatest casualties, produced the greatest feats of heroism,  and won or lost major campaigns. They decided the course of the war in the East  and the West, set the standard for valor and sacrifice, defined who the American  soldier was to be in this war and in the future, and established the American  military tradition.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This volume presents accounts of five Confederate victories (Fort Sumter, First  Manassas, Fredericksburg, Chickamauga, and Franklin), five Union victories (New  Orleans, Gettysburg, Vicksburg, Chattanooga, and Nashville), and three stalemates  (&lt;i&gt;Monitor v. Virginia&lt;/i&gt;, Antietam, and Charleston). Also included are chapters  on solder life, the steadfast Iron Brigade, and the first volunteer African-American  combat troops recruited in the North-the Fifty-fourth Massachusetts Infantry.  From the first shot in Charleston Harbor to the one-day decimation of the Southern  army on the outskirts of Nashville, these pages are colored with the wide range  of expectation and disappointment that frustrated the country during four years  of war.&lt;/p&gt;" />
