  <title>The Dirty Thirty - Richard W. Hudson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Imagine being just twenty-one, thirteen thousand miles from home in a strange country where the inhabitants want to kill you! Envision living in mud, eating food packed in 1941, witnessing hostilities from your enemies and among your friends. The Dirty Thirty explains life as it was as a Gun-Bunny, a trucker, a thief and a soldier in the jungles and towns of South Vietnam Live as a draftee lived among the diversity of an army of draftees. The odd and endearing characters of The Dirty Thirty and the strict military minds of the Lifers, will give you a glimpse of the real Vietnam experience. Jolt at the realization that the NVA was not an Evil Empire, but a military force with a cause and a heartfelt dedication among its soldiers. Be sad at the plights of individual U.S. soldiers at the mercy of the Military Machine. Be proud of the sacrifices made by the men and women of both sides during the 10,000 Day War.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dirty Thirty gives a day to day account of what life was really like on the fire bases in the jungles and hills of Vietnam and Cambodia in 1969-1970.&lt;/p&gt;" />
