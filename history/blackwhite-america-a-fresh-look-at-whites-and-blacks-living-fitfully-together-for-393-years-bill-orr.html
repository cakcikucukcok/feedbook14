  <title>Blackwhite America: A Fresh Look at Whites and Blacks Living Fitfully Together for 393 Years - Bill Orr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Bringing history to life, Blackwhite America chronicles the racial struggle since America&#39;s origins. Told in the first-person, present-tense voice of Thomas Jefferson, it is a story of stories, each one reliving a time of important change and decision-making. Orr takes an open-minded, well-researched, fresh look at how American whites and blacks lived fitfully together under common governments, from arrival of the first blacks to reelection of Barack Obama-1619-2012. Orr seeks insights to questions he poses at the outset: If the purpose of the Civil War was to free the slaves, why did it take more than a century and a half for blacks to get as close as we are now to equal rights? How far have we all come, really? When, if ever, will we get there? Where is &quot;there?&quot; Blackwhite America details the evolution of America&#39;s growth toward emancipation, the progress of civil rights, and the hope of racial equality." />
