  <title>Staying One Step Ahead of Interpol - Teresita Chism, Edward Chism</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a true story of how a man and wife; the co-authors of this amazing experience; who gave so much to their respective countries; sacrificed, struggled and suffered through the horrors of extreme political persecution.
It is also about their flight to survive, to save their own lives after the savage U.S. Military Invasion of the Republic of Panama in December 1989; and other events, such as the Sandinista-Contra-U.S. inspired war in Central America.  
In the process it will bring out the occurrence of numerous acts of deceitful cover ups, lies, dishonesty, and diverse illegal conduct by those who preached the Rule of Law.
This account will link together many of the not so legal or moral activities of the Washington right wing establishment, during the decade of the 1980s; their improper foreign policy in promoting illegal wars in Latin America; while at the same time having relations with terrorist regimes; and drug dealers, in other areas of the world.  
In the process it will bring to the surface the extremes to which some power groups will resort to; in order to reach their political, personal and economic objectives; along with their avarice, greed, and self indulgence.
It will lead you to an understanding of the origins and illicit justification of some of the major cover ups of recent times. It will show, in the process, how American politicians and their Judicial System fell right into the muck and sewage, along with their self serving interests.
It is a chilling account of vengeance, pursuit, endurance, injustice, faith, mental torture; and physical danger of two people, along with their unyielding commitment to survive.  
All against the perils of clandestine capture, illegal extradition; the tropical jungles, judicial persecution, envy and retribution, defamation, illicit prosecution, confiscation of assets; and an International Police hunt in the course of extremely inhospitable terrain; through guerrilla cells of insurgency and a journey across different countries.
PAGE 2 	BOOK DESCRIPTION CHISM BOOK ID 57251
This will exhibit a perfect example of the perverse U.S. Consular Visa revocation process against one of Americas most committed supporters; in a dreadful showing of the astonishing improprieties and failures in the application of U.S. Diplomacy.
Events in this version will give enormous insight into the progression of the Panama Canal Treaty, mandated transfer of all U.S. Panama Canal and military assets, to the Republic of Panama.  None of which would occur without a complex, extreme, painful and deadly changeover process.
It is also a story, never before told, of the monstrous effort, carried out to safeguard the operational integrity of the most important waterway in the world in favor of world shipping and commerce.
This all made possible by the resolve, loyalty, commitment and strength of the protagonists who carried the weight of the responsibilities, necessary for this to be so; even during a time when the Winds of War of the United States of America; blew incessantly stronger toward the shores of the Republic of Panama.
In the course of it all, the devastating effects of the application of the 
Law de Jante will become clear to all.
Many lessons have surely been learned from these torturous events.  The problem is that human minds are generally quick to forget whatever they dont wish to remember 
Better by far you should forget and smile /
Than that you should remember and 
Be sad.
