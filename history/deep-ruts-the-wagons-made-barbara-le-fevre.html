  <title>Deep Ruts the Wagons Made - Barbara Le-Fevre</title>

&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&#39;&gt;There were numerous tribes scattered all across the
United States long before they were discovered by foreigners The white
man.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The period of the Indians was long
when they lived within the confinement of the lands they called home. These
lands that they cherished, their beliefs they cherished. They were one with the
almighty one and free for hundreds of years but in a blink of an eye, they lost
it all. They were hunted and annihilated ridiculed and persecuted. They were a
race indifferent to us but they were a race the foreigners on their lands
didn&#39;t want and by what ever means possible they meant to disperse these people
from their homes and take from them everything they owned and they did just
that. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&#39;&gt;When Christopher Columbus born 1451 the son of Domenio
Columbus stepped ashore on American soil on the 12th October 1492 everything
changed for the Indians.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;By the time De
Sota and Ponce De Leon arrived searching for gold and slaves many an Indian had
died at their hands.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;At this time there
were supposedly some 10 million Indians inhabiting the land but after three
centuries this number was reduced by 90%. The English arrived then the French
and the Dutch every&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Sovereign wanted a
piece of the land to claim as their own and the Indians succumbed to diseases
imported by the whites. Famine and warfare were directed at them as the white
people pushed them further and further away from their own lands so they could
claim and prosper by them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&#39;&gt;Before 1600 there were about one million Indians who
lived north of the Rio Grande speaking some 2,000 languages but most of these
languages are dead now. These people lived mainly of the land growing maize,
fishing and hunting to feed their people. When the Europeans arrived that all
changed and destruction quickly followed as these intruders wanting what the
Indians had and what was on their lands. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&#39;&gt;In New England the tribes were hit by diseases
brought by the white men which wiped out thousands. The Indian people were
cheated by the Quakers, disgraced by the Iroquois and defeated by the Dutch in
the Esopus wars of 1660. They never stood a chance against these people and
hundred&#39;s of years later they still didn&#39;t stand a chance.&lt;span
style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&#39;&gt;By 1840 all the Eastern tribes, those that had
survived annihilation were forcibly removed to Indian territory west of the
Mississippi. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&#39;&gt;There are no words which could compensate for the
suffering over the years of these people, the Native Americans, the Indians.
These people who were pushed and shoved all over the United States, starved and
murdered, beaten and humiliated but they are growing stronger. They are
reclaiming their heritage and people are listening. To many lies were told, to
many treaties broken. Many of the tribes who lived in the United States before
their exodus to Indian Lands or their extinction can be found at the back of
this book. This list may not fully represent all the tribes which inhabited the
land over the period. There are many long forgotten names of tribes who were
completely obliterated over the years when peace was hard to come by. The
tribes listed though do represent a vast majority of the Indians living in the
United States during the period before the white man caused some of them to be
extinct.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&#39;&gt;There were many tales of greed throughout the
period. Many of the tribes included in this book suffered harshly at the hands
of soldiers. The same soldiers the Government had sent to protect them, when in
fact, all they did was abuse them for their own ends and for greed and in some
cases glory.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&#39;&gt;The subject of the Native American Indian has always
been a touchy one. At times they have been overlooked. At times they have been
portrayed as the &quot;savages&quot;,&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;We have found out over the years that this was not so in many cases. A
large injustice was dealt to these people. The real history of these people
like many other events has been swept under the American carpet so it is easier
to forget whose lands you now live on. Whose blood lies dried in the earth.
Whose bones are scattered, some not in peace as even in death some archeologist
is looking for artifact&#39;s, they do not care if the ground is sacred or not. The
Indians paid their price to live upon this earth, let their spirits go free.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&#39;&gt;Hard to believe, not really considering the record
of the white settlers and the forcible removal of the Indians from their lands
especially when Gold was found. Eyes lit up, greed set in and murder began. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&#39;&gt;Yes their story has been written before and it
probably will be again for there is a never ending quest for truth and justice
for these people, the real first Americans who we seem to overlook at times,
for they are the indigenous people.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
