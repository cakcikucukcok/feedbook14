  <title>Secret Wars - Gordon Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Gordon Thomas has established himself as a leading expert on the intelligence community. He returns here on the one hundredth anniversaries of Britain&#39;s Security and Secret Intelligence Services to provide the definitive history of the famed MI5 and MI6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These agencies rank as two of the oldest and most powerful in the world, and Thomas&#39;s wide-sweeping history chronicles a century of both triumphs and failures.  He recounts the roles that British intelligence played in the Allied victory in World War II; the postwar treachery of Great Britain&#39;s own agents; the defection of Soviet agents and the intricate process of &quot;handling&quot; them; the often frigid relationship that both agencies have had with the CIA, European spy services, and the Mossad; the cooperation between the British and Americans in the search for Osama bin Laden; and the ways in which MI5 and MI6 have fought biological warfare espionage and space terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All told, this is the story of two agencies led by men---and women---who are enigmatic, eccentric, and controversial, and who ruthlessly control their spies. Based on prodigious research and interviews with significant players from inside the British intelligence community, this is a rich and even delicious history packed with intrigue and information that only the author could have attained.&lt;/p&gt;" />
