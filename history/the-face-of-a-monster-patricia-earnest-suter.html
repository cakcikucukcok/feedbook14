  <title>The Face of a Monster - Patricia Earnest Suter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The year 2018 will herald the 200th anniversary of Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley&amp;#39;s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frankenstein,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; or The Modern Prometheus. &lt;/em&gt;The timing seems right for the story of a real monster.&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;German-born immigrant Anton Probst arrived in New York in 1863. &lt;/em&gt;Within two hours of his arrival he enlisted in the Union Army. During the American Civil War, Probst bore witness to mankind&amp;#39;s brutality. Afterwards, he became an inmate at the disreputable&amp;nbsp;Blockley Almshouse in Philadelphia.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt; was first conceived by Shelley in 1816. Her monster was an embodiment of abandonment and loneliness, feelings Shelley shared. In despair, the creature resorted to violence. Fifty years after &lt;em&gt;Frankenstein&amp;#39;s&lt;/em&gt; conception, Anton Probst&amp;nbsp;adopted characteristics of Shelley&amp;#39;s monstrous creation. He became Philadelphia&amp;#39;s first mass-murderer when he slaughtered members of the Christopher Dearing family.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After his death, Probst&amp;#39;s story continued. The creature that he had become left a deep impression on the people of Philadelphia and New York. Researchers used Anton Probst&amp;#39;s body to show the effects of galvanization, the same means by which Frankenstein&amp;#39;s monster stirred to life. Incredibly, similarities surface between Shelley and her circle, her monster, and events that transpired when the blood of innocents was&amp;nbsp;shed an ocean away. One defining difference is present. Unlike Shelley&amp;#39;s creature, the story of America&amp;#39;s monster is very real.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
