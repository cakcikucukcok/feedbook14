  <title>The Conquest of Labor: Daniel Pratt and Southern Industrialization - Curtis J. Evans</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Conquest of Labor offers the first biography of Daniel Pratt (1799-1873), a New Hampshire native who became one of the South&#39;s most important industrialists. After moving to Alabama in 1833, Pratt started a cotton gin factory near Montgomery that by the eve of the Civil War had become the largest in the world. Pratt became a household name in cotton-growing states, and Prattville-the site of his operations-one of the antebellum South&#39;s most celebrated manufacturing towns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on a rich cache of personal and business records, Curtis J. Evans&#39;s study of Daniel Pratt and his &quot;Yankee&quot; town in the heart of the Deep South challenges the conventional portrayal of the South as a premodern region hostile to industrialization and shows that, contrary to current popular thought, the South was not so markedly different from the North.&lt;/p&gt;" />
