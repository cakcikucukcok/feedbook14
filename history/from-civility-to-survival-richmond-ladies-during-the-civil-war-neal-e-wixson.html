  <title>From Civility to Survival: Richmond Ladies During the Civil War - Neal E. Wixson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Motivated by their patriotism, the Richmond Ladies were willing to make the necessary sacrifices for the Southern cause. Many sent their husbands and sons to fight for the glory of the South. However, as the war progressed, their sacrifices became harder and harder to bear. They faced shortages of food, struggled to find adequate housing, and, in some cases, endured the ultimate price of losing husbands, sons, and close relatives. As Richmond was evacuated, they braced themselves for military occupation and reconstruction. With the loss of their slaves, wealth, social standing, and homes, they entered into a new world order with few familiar aspects. Through their diaries and recollections, their story of courage and commitment to survive in an ever changing world is told.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Neal Wixson selected detailed, poignant and sentimental excerpts from some of the most important accounts of Richmond during the Civil War which succeeds in capturing much of the flavor of the Confederate capital as seen through womens eyes.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;b&gt;Michael B. Chesson&lt;/b&gt;, Professor of History, The American College of History and Legal
Studies and author of several books including Richmond after the War 1865-1890&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A vivid account of wartime Richmond as told by women who endured its physical and emotional hardships.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Carol Sheriff&lt;/b&gt; , Professor of History, College of William &amp; Mary and author of The
Artificial River and of co-author of A People at War&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;By giving voice to the ladies who lived in Richmond during the Civil War, Neal Wixson offers a chorus of their faith and perseverance in enduring deprivations and sacrifice.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
