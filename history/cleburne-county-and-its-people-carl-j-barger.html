  <title>Cleburne County and Its People - Carl J. Barger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Cleburne County and Its People&lt;/EM&gt; &lt;/STRONG&gt;is a historical account of Cleburne County and the men and women who made it what it is today. These men and women were as diverse as the Ozark Mountain&#39;s rock-laden landscapes.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The pioneers who settled Cleburne County were as strong as the land, of hardy pioneer stock, and bold in thought and action. They were shrewd, strong-willed individuals who brought staunch beliefs and strong disciplines with them and settled in an untamed wilderness which became Cleburne County.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Cleburne County and Its People&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;has drawn from the past and the present--chronicling the lives of settlers facing hardships and tragedies, discovering profound beauty, mastering vast natural resources, and formulating democratic ideals. The stories in this book are honest interpretations of the human experience intertwined with the old and the new and adding exciting dimensions to the county of Cleburne and the state of Arkansas.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The objective of Carl J. Barger, the compiler of &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Cleburne County and Its People&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;, is to preserve a history of the county of his birth for students, historians, and all of the citizens of Cleburne County.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Carl J. Barger is the author of &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Swords and Plowshares&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;, a Civil War love story, and &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Mamie, an Ozark Mountain Girl of&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Courage&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;, a story of the Ozark Mountain people, set in Cleburne and Van Buren Counties.&lt;/P&gt;
