  <title>Beginnings in Science and its Teaching - Collier Cobb, James J. Walsh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;The  medieval universities and the school-men who taught sciences have been  particularly blamed for their failure to occupy themselves with  realities instead of with speculation. We are coming to recognize their  wonderful zeal for education, the large numbers of students they  attracted, the enthusiasm of their students since they made so many  hand-written copies of the books of their masters, the devotion of the  teachers themselves, who wrote at much greater length than do our  professors even now and on the most abstruse subjects, so that it is all  the more surprising to think they should have neglected science.  &lt;br/&gt;
&quot;Long  before the sciences were pressing their claim to equal rank with  ancient learning at Harvard, before Jefferson had seen the establishment  of the University of Virginia working under the system of elective  studies which he had planned, or before the magnificently endowed  institutions of technology were giving what Herbert Spencer regards as  knowledge of most worth, we find the beginnings of these things in the  newly established university of a State that could boast of only two  schools which taught more than the three R&#39;s and the very rudiments of  the English language...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
