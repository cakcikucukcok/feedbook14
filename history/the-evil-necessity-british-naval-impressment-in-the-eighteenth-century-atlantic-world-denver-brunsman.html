  <title>The Evil Necessity: British Naval Impressment in the Eighteenth-Century Atlantic World - Denver Brunsman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fundamental component of Britain&#39;s early success, naval     impressment not only kept the Royal Navy afloat-it helped to make an empire. In total numbers,     impressed seamen were second only to enslaved Africans as the largest group of forced laborers     in the eighteenth century.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Evil Necessity,&lt;/i&gt; Denver     Brunsman describes in vivid detail the experience of impressment for Atlantic seafarers and     their families. Brunsman reveals how forced service robbed approximately 250,000 mariners of     their livelihoods, and, not infrequently, their lives, while also devastating Atlantic seaport     communities and the loved ones who were left behind. Press gangs, consisting of a navy officer     backed by sailors and occasionally local toughs, often used violence or the threat of violence     to supply the skilled manpower necessary to establish and maintain British naval supremacy.     Moreover, impressments helped to unite Britain and its Atlantic coastal territories in a common     system of maritime defense unmatched by any other European empire.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Drawing on     ships&#39; logs, merchants&#39; papers, personal letters and diaries, as well as engravings,     political texts, and sea ballads, Brunsman shows how ultimately the controversy over impressment     contributed to the American Revolution and served as a leading cause of the War of     1812.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early American HistoriesWinner of the Walker Cowen Memorial Prize for an     Outstanding Work of Scholarship in Eighteenth-Century Studies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
