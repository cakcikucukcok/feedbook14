&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;&quot;&gt;It was also mentioned by the Georgian Society of England in the 1930s and again in the 1950s as a charming Georgian town in the Caribbean; and more recently in 2004, St. Georges-the prettiest little town in the Caribbean by George Brizan, which was a limited publication for Zublins promotional thrust for his proposed St. Georges Renaissance Project, which appears to be out of circulation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;&quot;&gt;All of the above dealt mainly with its historical, political, social and cultural evolution,but in 1988, at the celebration of the 500th year of the coming of Columbus to the New World, CARIMOSthe cultural arm of the Organisation of American States (OAS), sponsored a technical report by the Faculty of Architecture of the University of Florida to mark the occasion, when St. Georges was described as a Monument of the wider Caribbean. A few years later in 1991 the Physical Planning Unit prepared the St. Georges Development Plan under the direction of the then Planning OfficerMr. Carlton Frederick, assisted by a United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Consultant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
