  <title>The Oxford Handbook of Demosthenes - Gunther Martin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As a speechwriter, orator, and politician, Demosthenes captured, embodied, and shaped his time. He was a key player in Athens in the twilight of the city&#39;s independence, and is today a primary source for its history and society during that period. The Oxford Handbook of Demosthenes sets out to explore the many facets of his life, work, and time, giving particular weight to elucidating the settings and contexts of his activities, as well as some of the key
themes dealt with in his speeches, and thereby illustrating the interplay and mutual influence between his rhetoric and the environment from which it emerged.
The volume&#39;s thirty-five chapters are authored by experts in the field and offer both comprehensive coverage and an up-to-date reference point for the issues and problems encountered when approaching the speeches in particular: they not only showcase how Demosthenes&#39; rhetoric was profoundly influenced by Athenian reality, but also explore its reception from Demosthenes&#39; own day right up until the present and how his presentation of his world has subsequently shaped our view of it. The wide
range of expertise and the different scholarly traditions represented are a vivid demonstration of the richness and diversity of current Demosthenic studies and the contribution the volume makes to enriching our knowledge of the life and work of one of the most prominent figures of ancient Greece will be
of significance to a wide readership interested in Athenian history, society, rhetoric, politics, and law." />
