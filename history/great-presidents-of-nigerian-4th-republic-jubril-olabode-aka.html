  <title>Great Presidents of Nigerian 4Th Republic - Jubril Olabode Aka</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Great Presidents of Nigerian 4th Republic
          Nigeria has arrived; Nigeria is born again with the most credible April 2011 general and presidential elections in 50 years according to International Community. 
          President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, VP Namadi Sambo and INEC Chairman, Professor Attahiru Jega deserve national and international honours. President Jonathan won landslide with 23 million votes across all party lines.
          The &#39;Promised Land&#39; journey begins in earnest. Nigeria is marching forward steadfastly despite bumps and teething gestation problems to encounter.
	With 160 Million inhabitants, Nigeria is worlds largest concentration of Blacks. 
          President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan&#39;s presidency beginning May 29, 2011 represents the fulfillment of hope, change, salvation, good luck and blessings after decades of military dictatorships between 1966 and 1999.
	Structured like USA Presidency, bi-cameral Legislature and Independent Judiciary, Nigeria became beloved to International Community sooner than anticipated. 
	With membership in UN, OPEC, Commonwealth of Nations, AU, ECOWAS, NEPAD, Nigeria is seventh worlds largest petroleum supplier and fifth supplier to USA.  
          Nigeria is becoming economic super-power - &#39;Vision 2020&#39; with abundance of oil, gas, bitumen, gold, etc.
	Nigeria is beautified by Atlantic Ocean, Rivers Niger and Benue, Lake Chad, Tinapa Holiday Resort (world-class), Olumo Rock, Igbesa Free Trade Zone.
	Nigeria, blessed and protected from natural disasters never witnessed devastating Tsunami, Katrina, volcano, thunderstorm, iceberg, earthquake and mudslide that wipe-out settlements and kill thousands seasonally.
	International Social Scientists 4-year survey rated Nigeria as the worlds happiest country (2006) while USA, Britain, Japan and Russia were outside the first 10.  Also, International Financial Agencies confirmed Nigerias 35% return on investment as worlds highest.
	Nigerias incredible hospitality encourages some Americans, Europeans and Asians to become naturalized citizens of Nigeria.	Oil-rich country Nigeria, often described as African giant, peace and power broker Nigeria, granted amnesties to secessionists (1970), Niger Delta militants (2009) and settled Bakassi Peninsula dispute with Cameroon (2006) diplomatically.
	War-mongering super-powers and allies, intimidating and occupying weaker nations illegally, should emulate Nigerian leadership examples of Presidents Obasanjo, YarAdua and Jonathans peaceful conflict resolution best practices for world peace.
	Wake Up Nigerians!  Make Nigeria Great and Prosperous!  Failure Is Not An Option!  Nigerians Are Tired of Excuses for Avoidable Leadership Indiscretion and Slumber for 50 Years of Independence!   
                   Always Put Nigeria First! Change &#39;Business as Usual&#39;! 
GOD BLESS THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA!" />
