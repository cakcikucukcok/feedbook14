  <title>A History of Amersham - Julian Hunt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this entertaining book the author identifies each of the old coaching inns which provide ample evidence of Amersham&#39;s importance as a stopping place on the great coach road from London to the Midlands. He traces the history of all the town&#39;s tanneries and proves that Weller&#39;s brewery is much older than previously believed and that its many maltings were selling vast quantities of malt to London brewers in the 17th century. He does not neglect the townspeople themselves, not least the Drakes of Shardeloes who dominated the political, religious and social life of Amersham for 350 years. Here he is able to draw on the unique knowledge of Barney Tyrwhitt Drake, a direct descendant. 
   Julian Hunt&#39;s well researched narrative is both comprehensive and easy to read. Splendidly illustrated, it is a significant contribution to the published history of Buckinghamshire and will be warmly welcomed in and around old Amersham itself!" />
