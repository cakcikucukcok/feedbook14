  <title>A Little Tour in France - Henry James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Often considered to be a classic literary guidebook, &amp;quot;A Little Tour in France&amp;quot; was first published in 1884 and is a first person narrative of Henry James&amp;#39;s travels through and thoughts on this country. From Tours to Dijon, James tells of the towns and cities, the church and inns, the museums and palaces. &amp;quot;I am ashamed to begin with saying that Touraine is the garden of France; that remark has long ago lost its bloom. The town of Tours, however, has something sweet and bright, which suggests that it is surrounded by a land of fruits. It is a very agreeable little city; few towns of its size are more ripe, more complete, or, I should suppose, in better humor with themselves and less disposed to envy the responsibilities of bigger places. It is truly the capital of its smiling province . . .&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Henry James, OM, son of theologian Henry James Sr., brother of the philosopher and psychologist William James and diarist Alice James, was an American-born author, one of the founders and leaders of a school of realism in fiction. He spent much of his life in England and became a British subject shortly before his death. He is primarily known for a series of major novels in which he portrayed the encounter of America with Europe. His plots centered on personal relationships, the proper exercise of power in such relationships, and other moral questions. His method of writing from the point of view of a character within a tale allowed him to explore the phenomena of consciousness and perception, and his style in later works has been compared to impressionist painting." />
