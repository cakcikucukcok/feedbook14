These constituted three tribes, known as Ramnes (the Romans proper, who gave name to the mixed people), Tities, and Luceres.

The heads of these families were called&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;patres&lt;/i&gt;, or &amp;quot;fathers,&amp;quot; and all the members patricians, that is, &amp;quot;children of the fathers.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
At the head of the nation stood the King, who was the father of the state. He was at once ruler of the people, commander of the army, judge and high priest of the nation, with absolute power as to life and death.&lt;br /&gt;
Next to the king stood the Senate, or &amp;quot;council of the old men,&amp;quot; composed of the &amp;quot;fathers,&amp;quot; or heads of the families.

The Popular Assembly (&lt;i&gt;comitia curiata&lt;/i&gt;) comprised all the citizens of Rome, that is, all the members of the patrician families, old enough to bear arms. It was this body that enacted the laws of the state, determined upon peace or war, and also elected the king..." />
