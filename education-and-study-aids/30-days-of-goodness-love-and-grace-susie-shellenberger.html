  <title>30 Days of Goodness, Love, and Grace - Susie Shellenberger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This insightful 30-day eBook Bible study contains selections from the Faithgirlz &lt;em&gt;Secret Power Girls Bible Study&lt;/em&gt; series. Written especially for fun-loving girls ages 8-12 by beloved author Susie Shellenberger, the deep truths found in each day will challenge, inspire, and nourish your growing soul. Includes selections from &lt;em&gt;The Secret Power of Love&lt;/em&gt; (book of Ruth), &lt;em&gt;The Secret Power of Grace&lt;/em&gt; (1 Peter), and &lt;em&gt;The Secret Power of Goodness&lt;/em&gt; (Colossians). &lt;em&gt;The Secret Power of Love&lt;/em&gt;: Like Cinderella, sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s easy to feel left out and ignored. Maybe things with your family aren&amp;rsquo;t right, or you don&amp;rsquo;t feel very lovable. But something amazing happens when you discover God&amp;rsquo;s love. Journey through the book of Ruth and study one girl&amp;rsquo;s real-life &amp;ldquo;Cinderella story,&amp;rdquo; and see how God transformed her world. &lt;em&gt;The Secret Power of Grace&lt;/em&gt;: You probably want to achieve great things. You probably want a happy life. And you probably want to look incredible every step of the way, sporting a style that makes you sparkle. For a girl like you, that&amp;rsquo;s no problem&amp;mdash;because you&amp;rsquo;re about to discover the secrets to true success, lasting joy, and a killer style you&amp;rsquo;ll never outgrow. Cruise through the book of 1 Peter and learn God&amp;rsquo;s ideas about a beauty and style unlike anything money can buy at the mall. &lt;em&gt;The Secret Power of Goodness&lt;/em&gt;: Sometimes it seems everyone has a different idea of what is true. Some people say that truth is simply whatever works for you. But what if you found reliable truth&amp;mdash;as solid and real as the ground you walk on? What if it changed your life? What if it changed you? Come explore the book of Colossians and learn to sort through what you hear about other&amp;rsquo;s beliefs while discovering what makes our faith special and what it means to be a Christian.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
