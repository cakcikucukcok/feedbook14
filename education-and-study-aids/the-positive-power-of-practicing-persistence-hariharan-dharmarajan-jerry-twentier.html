  <title>The Positive Power of Practicing Persistence - Hariharan Dharmarajan, Jerry Twentier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever started a project and never finished? Have you ever tackled a challenge only to give up halfway through? Have you ever lost your enthusiasm or confidence midstream? Of course that happens to everyone. The Positive Power of Practicing Persistence provides a powerful jump-start to get us moving again when we get stalled. Readers will walk away with a potent vaccination of never-give-up kind of persistence to employ in every facet of their personal and professional lives. 
The book opens with an inspiring account of the authors true life experience of leaving his homeland in India to migrate to a new country and culture. It is an inspiring diary of perseverance and determination to overcome all obstacles and barriers to achieve success in a challenging environment. 
In The Positive Power of Practicing Persistence, the author has selected fifteen inspiring stories of remarkable individuals who refused to concede their dreams. While some are well-known, others are relatively unknown. Inventors and entertainers, presidents and prisoners, saints and prophetsall are showcased in the book to illustrate that persistence can be applied by any person, anywhere and in any set of circumstances. Personal stories of Thomas Edison, Mother Theresa, Walt Disney, Nelson Mandela, Roger Barrister, J. K. Rowling, and Mahatma Gandhi are included. A couple of lighter stories featuring The Tortoise and the Hare and The Little Engine That Could add another layer of assurance that persistence wins on all levels. 
The final third of the book deals with the practical how-to-do-it methods to cultivate a greater resolve in our lives. These valuable how-to chapters engage readers in immediate action steps in how to persist in winning that dream job, getting the sale, achieving education goals, eliminating debt, and that all-elusive goal that plagues us allhow to persist in losing weight and getting fit! 
Other how-to chapters feature the art of teaching persistence to your children. Sprinkled through each chapter are quotes to motivate and inspire readers in their struggle to persist. Each chapter concludes with a key summary statement. 
The Positive Power of Practicing Persistence is a sure-fire way to reignite that fire within each of us to achieve everything we were designed to do." />
