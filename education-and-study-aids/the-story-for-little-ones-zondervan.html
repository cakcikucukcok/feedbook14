  <title>The Story for Little Ones - Zondervan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Now that they know their ABCs and 1-2-3s, are your children ready to start reading? The Picture That! Bible Storybook will help kids ages 6 and under feel like reading is easy-and fun too! This picture reader sprinkles over 90 full-color picture icons into more than 65 Bible stories. Noah and the ark full of animals, David and the giant, Jesus calming the storm, the angel at the empty tomb-these are just a few of the Old and New Testament stories your kids will be reading-yes reading! The icons will encourage them to jump from picture to picture and then try to read some words in between. To help keep things interesting, various layouts with full-page illustrations and some larger picture icons fill the pages of the Picture That! Bible Storybook-readers will be excited to see what&#39;s coming next! And at the end of each story, a simple, one-line lesson helps children remember what it teaches and offers to apply what they learn. Based on the New International Reader&#39;s version (the Bible translation for beginning readers), the Picture That! Bible Storybook is reading at its easiest. This unique, creative book is bound to become a favorite with children and parents alike. Written by best-selling author Tracy Harrast." />
