  <title>The African American Male School Adaptability Crisis (Amsac) - Joe L. Rempson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The African American Male School Adaptability Crisis (AMSAC) cannot be solved by the school alone. It is a race problem which can only be solved if we black males provide the leadership in tackling our three major demons which now mainly account for the problem: IQ lag-fatherless families-crime. AMSAC had its origin about 100 years ago when, after the death of Washington, DuBois gained ascendancy in our African American Garden of Eden and replaced Washingtons brains, property, and character gospel with a civil rights agenda. That agenda has led to a civil-rights fixation and our second bondage, Victimology, wherein being the victim has become part of our core identity and made us psychological slaves. Rather than being proud and self-reliant, disproportionately, we have come to see ourselves as victims who are entitled to system help and special treatment. This bondage  and it is a bondage -- vitiates our manhood and the energy and drive required to pursue the adaptation pathway paved by Washington, but demonized by DuBois. Return to that pathway and we can confront and conquer AMSAC and our three major demons. Guided by history and the research evidence, this book details how. Its 20 chapters make for long reading, but, just by reading the first and last chapters, you can get the message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The motto of the proposed evidence-based experimental program, the African American Male Career Pathway Program (AMCAP). A special appeal is made to black athletes and entertainers to help propagate this motto and support the proposed high school student clubs (Student AMCAPs) in its implementation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
