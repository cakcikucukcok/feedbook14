  <title>So! You Want to Study Chemistry What! You Need to Know - Gaines Bradford Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This storehouse of knowledge was designed and written primarily for the entry level college student who wanted to pursue a career in the Hard science, such as Chemistry.
Most entry level students in the college arena have difficulty in the hard sciences, generally due to a weak mathematics background. This unique book, compiled by an individual who had over thirty years of teaching experience, has accumulated in one single reference source: the essentials of basic arithmetic for the fundamental operations of additions, subtraction, multiplication, and division of whole numbers, decimals, fractions, and mixed numbers with some imbedded mathematical short-cuts; the essentials for the mathematical manipulation of exponentially expressed extremely small and extremely large numbers; the essentials of algebraic expressions and manipulations of various formulas with a full explanation of logarithms; the essentials of basic calculus for the comprehension of non-static systems; and finally a chapter on the basic concepts, constructs, and vocabulary associated with discipline known as Chemistry. As an additional learning mechanism, the chapter on chemistry has about forty problems presented with an associated Solutions Manual imbedded in the appendices of the overall text. Also for the readers benefit, within the appendices is a chronological presentation of the Laws, their formulas, concepts, and vocabulary associated with any basic course in chemistry as a ready reference section in case one needed a quick review on some constructs. In addition, other chapters of the book fully explain the diversity and the many opportunities open to one that has a background in chemistry and the future trends in the overall discipline." />
