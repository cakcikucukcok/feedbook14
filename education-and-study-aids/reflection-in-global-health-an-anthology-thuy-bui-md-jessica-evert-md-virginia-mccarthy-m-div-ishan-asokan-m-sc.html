  <title>Reflection In Global Health: An Anthology - Thuy Bui, Md, Jessica Evert, Md, Virginia McCarthy, M. Div., Ishan Asokan, M. Sc....</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This anthology includes sixty-three essays that explore an array of topics as they relate to global health, and it is the cumulative effort of students, educators, and advocates dedicated to helping others.   Moving beyond sayings like, &quot;They have so little, but they&#39;re so happy,&quot; and  &quot;All you need is love,&quot; the essays take a systematic, reflective approach to experiences in global health.  Nauzley Abedini reveals the sensory overload she experienced while conducting a yearlong research fellowship in Kumasi, Ghana, and how accepting that she would never be embraced allowed her to revise her goals and realize that being seen as an outsider is not necessarily incompatible with being accepted or familiar.   Ishan Asokan looks back at his time in Amman, the capital city of Jordan, and how he visited a Syrian refugee camp an hour&#39;s drive from a bounty of medical aid. He finds countless people suffering, and all he can give them is love." />
