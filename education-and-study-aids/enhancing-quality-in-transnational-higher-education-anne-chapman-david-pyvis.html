  <title>Enhancing Quality in Transnational Higher Education - Anne Chapman, David Pyvis</title>

The focus of the book is on what makes for a good and successful education in the context of transnational programs of Australian universities. The book traces research by the authors into the &amp;lsquo;lived experiences&amp;rsquo; of teachers and learners engaged in Australian transnational education across a broad range of universities, locations, programs and models of delivery. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The enormous trend towards the delivery of university programs across national borders is compelling evidence of the internationalization of higher education in the 21&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;st&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span&gt; century. Universities worldwide are challenged to provide quality assurance for this new kind of education. For universities, this book &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;offers principles to enhance existing frameworks for assuring the quality of learning and teaching in university offshore education programs. The book will also&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; be of particular interest to academics of higher education institutions who are involved in the policy and practice of transnational education.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
