  <title>Practical Strategies for Supporting Emotional Regulation in Students with Autism - Leslie Blome, Maureen Zelle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For professionals who work with students on the autism spectrum in inclusive classroom settings, supporting emotional regulation is key. This practical guide outlines cognitive and language strategies that support emotional regulation, which the authors have found successful with their students with autism, supported by research that shows why they work.
The focus in this book is on the emotional state of the child as opposed to controlling behaviours. The guidelines and strategies provided help students with prediction and make the expectations of them clear, empowering children by giving them choices. Examples of how to use each strategy are given, alongside tips for application. The book also includes sample goals for regulation, information on therapy techniques that work and a &#39;cheat sheet&#39; overview of the strategies, creating a clear and concise guide to engaging and enhancing learning in the classroom." />
