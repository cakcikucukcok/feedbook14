  <title>The Greatest Commandment - David T. Steineker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Greatest Commandment: Matthew 22:37 focuses upon the meaning and impact of Jesuss proclamation that the primary mandate from God is to love him with all of ones heart and soul and mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author, David T. Steineker, reviews how understanding this primary command helps one to appreciate the ways in which God has constructed the world according to his law. As a result, The Greatest Commandment contends that one will see the traces of Gods law in the design of the physical world and in Gods intentions for humanity. In addition, chapters explore several topics of controversy in modern society: evolution and abortion. Finally, a sequence of chapters explores the focus upon Jesus Christ that emerges from the text of Matthew 22:37, the fidelity of the discipleship of John the Baptist, and the final things that will come at the end of this age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you desire to learn how Jesuss teaching of the Great Commandment can provide shape and meaning to your life and guide you to understand Gods design for the world, then The Greatest Commandment: Matthew 22:37 will serve as your handbook for learning and living in harmony with Gods intentions for your life and for the unfolding history of the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
