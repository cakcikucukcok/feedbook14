  <title>The Evolution of Instructional Technology - Joseph O. Esin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Part I of the book notes that instructors apprehension is directly related to inadequate preparation, which contributes to their inability to apply technology to the educational process. The author offers a comprehensive outline and solutions on how to overcome instructors apprehension through the implementation of well-conceived professional technology training program that will allow instructors to learn at a pace that is challenging, but achievable.&lt;/p&gt;
Part II of the book describes major trends in academic settings, and the proposal that can help to bridge the gap between higher education administrators and wage increases for academic instructors. The apparent trend can be avoided through the implementation of an Academic Salary Review Council (ASRC) to assist in determining the boundary of administrators, and instructors wage increases, and benefits based on academic rank, and years of teaching experience. In addition, the book recommends a smooth and systematic form of departure from the textbook format to the instructional use of technology to guide and deliver instruction." />
