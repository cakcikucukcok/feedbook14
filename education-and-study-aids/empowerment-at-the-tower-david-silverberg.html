  <title>Empowerment at the Tower - David Silverberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many colleges/universities, their professors, and their students are waking up to the question: &amp;ldquo;how can we transform our institution to meet the needs of today&amp;rsquo;s professors and students?&amp;rdquo; This book offers real-life depictions of how colleges and universities, often mired in calcified practices, beliefs, and aspirations are remaking their approach to Leadership &amp;amp; Identity - mid-flight - by confronting complacency and building new kinds of futuristic and humanistic programs and practices. It offers thought-provoking and instructive insights into the personalities and policies that enhance, or detract from, institutional evolution and provides practical insights into key levers for targeted, transformational growth. Chapter authors present dynamic case studies from 6 institutions in 5 states along with touching interviews that provide insights about being a change agent and impacting institutional change. Probing questions are offered to readers along with a unique worksheet designed to intentionally promote new light bulb moments at one&amp;rsquo;s own college/university. This book offers thought-provoking and instructive insights into the personalities and policies that enhance, or detract from, institutional evolution and provides practical insights into key levers for targeted, transformational growth. Each case study includes information about the Background for the Change Initiative, the Change Initiative Itself, Challenges &amp;amp; Successes, and Lessons Learned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
