  <title>Becoming a Globally Competent Teacher - Ariel Tichnor-Wagner, Hillary Parkhouse, Jocelyn Glazier, J. Montana Cain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Teachers today must prepare students for an increasingly complex, interconnected, and interdependent world. Being a globally competent teacher requires embracing a mindset that translates personal global competence into professional classroom practice. It is a vision of equitable teaching and learning that enables students to thrive in an ever-changing world.
&lt;p&gt;This thought-provoking book introduces a proven self-reflection tool to help educators of all grade levels and content areas develop 12 elements of such teaching. The book is divided into three sections: dispositions, knowledge, and skills. Each chapter is devoted to an element of globally competent teaching and includes a description of that element, tips for implementation delineated by developmental levels, and links to additional resources for continuing the journey. 
&lt;p&gt;Examples of globally competent teaching practices include
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; - Empathy and valuing multiple perspectives.
&lt;br&gt; - A commitment to promoting equity worldwide.
&lt;br&gt; - An understanding of global conditions and current events.
&lt;br&gt; - The ability to engage in intercultural communication.
&lt;br&gt; - A classroom environment that values diversity and global engagement.
&lt;p&gt;Throughout, you&#39;ll also find examples of these practices at work from real teachers in real schools. No matter what your experience with global teaching, the information in this book will help you further develop your practice as a global educator&amp;mdash;a teacher who prepares students not only for academic success but also for a life in which they are active participants in their own communities and the wider world. &lt;/p&gt;" />
