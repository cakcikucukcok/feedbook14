  <title>Leila’S &amp; Kim’S Pre-College Vocabulary in Context &amp; Properly Graded  Grammar Workbook-2 Levels One – Six for Japanese-Chinese-South America-Korean-Arab &amp; English Speaking-College Seekers - Sam Christian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Title: &quot;Leila&#39;s And Kim&#39;s Pre-college Vocabulary in Context and Graded Grammar
Exercises&quot;
This Workbook {is a valuable tool put forward for the benefit of aspiring Leila and
ambitious Kim and their high school and pre-college peers who would use it to enrich their
repertoire of vocabulary and review their English Grammar to help them cope with their
post high school and college requirements and to satisfy their search and eagerness to using
the language smoothly and with confidence. In fact, in order to respond to Leila&#39;s strong
desire to learn and Kim&#39;s tremendous love of developing language proficiency, this
Workbook contains a large number of Vocabulary Exercises totaling more than 200 which
are intended to help enrich users by more than 3000 words of common use, most of which
are part of the International Word List and carly college textbook items, in addition to the
many other items used in the multiple-choice-question distractors. Similarly, there are
more than 200 Grammar Exercises of 20 items each. Both the Vocabulary and the
Grammar Exercises are supplied with answers at the end of each exercise to facilitate
reference instead of having tables appended at the end of the book, which are not usually
referred to by many users. A user of the Workbook, however, should only look at the
answers once he or she has finished the exercise to compare the answers. The context
sentences used in the Workbook are simple and are meant to please Kim and thrill Leila
rather than frustrate their efforts or waste their valuable time.
The review exercises have not been haphazardly written, but are the result of many
years of working with the likes of Leila and Kim here and abroad as well as personal
involvement in program development, text and test writing, research and note-taking in
order to decide the context in which an item should fit.
Finally, whether the user of this Workbook is a high school student, a pre-college or
university student, or a job seeker, it is certainly an excellent tool in hand and A Road to
College and Career Success&#39; only if the exercises are given the time and the effort required!" />
