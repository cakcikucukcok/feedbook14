  <title>The Happy, Healthy Nonprofit - Aliza Sherman, Beth Kanter, Vu Le</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Steer your organization away from burnout while boosting all-around performance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Happy, Healthy Nonprofit&lt;/i&gt; presents realistic strategies for leaders looking to optimize organizational achievement while avoiding the common nonprofit burnout. With a uniquely holistic approach to nonprofit leadership strategy, this book functions as a handbook to help leaders examine their existing organization, identify trouble spots, and resolve issues with attention to all aspects of operations and culture. The expert author team walks you through the process of building a happier, healthier organization from the ground up, with a balanced approach that considers more than just quantitative results. Employee wellbeing takes a front seat next to organizational performance, with clear guidance on establishing optimal systems and processes that bring about better results while allowing a healthier work-life balance. By improving attitudes and personal habits at all levels, you&#39;ll implement a positive cultural change with sustainable impact. &lt;p&gt;Nonprofits are driven to do more, more, more, often with fewer and fewer resources; there comes a breaking point where passion dwindles under the weight of pressure, and the mission suffers as a result. This book shows you how to revamp your organization to do more and do it better, by putting cultural considerations at the heart of strategy. &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Find and relieve cultural and behavioral pain points&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Achieve better results with attention to well-being&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Redefine your organizational culture to avoid burnout&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Establish systems and processes that enable sustainable change&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;At its core, a nonprofit is driven by passion. What begins as a personal investment in the organization&#39;s mission can quickly become the driver of stress and overwork that leads to overall lackluster performance. Executing a cultural about-face can be the lifeline your organization needs to thrive. &lt;i&gt;The Happy, Healthy Nonprofit&lt;/i&gt; provides a blueprint for sustainable change, with a holistic approach to improving organizational outlook." />
