  <title>Em@il Marketing For NEWBIES - Francisco Ramirez Inge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Em@il&amp;nbsp;Marketing For NEWBIES&lt;br /&gt;
If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever asked for information online about a product or service, or signed up for an e-list or group membership on the Internet, and received a nearly instantaneous response in your e-mail inbox, an autoresponder program was responsible for delivering the reply.&lt;br /&gt;
Simply put, autoresponders are e-mail programs that send out a preset message in response to every incoming e-mail received. Some autoresponders, like sign-up services for e-groups and forums, are one-shot deals: a single response for every message received. Just about every Internet-based company uses autoresponders for a variety of purposes, from automating tasks that would otherwise take up hundreds of man-hours to building lists and tracking prospective leads.&lt;br /&gt;
Multiple autoresponders send a series of messages to received e-mail addresses on a predetermined, timed basis. For instance, a multiple autoresponder can be used to send an instant response, then a follow-up message three days later, then another five days after that, and so on. It can be programmed to send a message a day, one per week, twice monthly, or any interval that satisfies the purpose of the message series.&lt;br /&gt;
Autoresponders are the most powerful internet marketing tools available. They are easy to use, and once they&amp;rsquo;re set up the entire marketing process is automated and instant. When you use autoresponders, your internet business runs itself 24 hours a day. Launching an effective autoresponder campaign can mean the difference between a struggling business and a wildly successful one.&lt;br /&gt;
How can I make money online with autoresponders?&lt;br /&gt;
Just about any online business can benefit by using autoresponders. In fact, with a properly arranged campaign, your as-yet-unfounded business can be built around an autoresponder program. All you need is a product and an effective series of autoresponder messages, and you can start carving your piece of the Internet pie.&lt;br /&gt;
Your autoresponder is your golden goose: the marketing tool that will sell your well-developed product far more effectively than any other form of advertising. Few sales are made by impulse buyers, particularly on the internet. But if you are able to get your message out repeatedly to people who are already interested in what you have to offer, you will see an explosive sales response.&lt;br /&gt;
This book will give you all the information you need to begin profiting with autoresponders. You&amp;rsquo;ll learn how to choose a topic that works best for you and your situation; research your market and find or develop great content that people want to buy; start you own automated storefront web site; tailor your autoresponder messages for maximum effectiveness; and build a powerful opt-in autoresponder list that will make money even while you sleep.&lt;br /&gt;
