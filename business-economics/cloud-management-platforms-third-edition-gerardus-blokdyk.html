  <title>Cloud Management Platforms Third Edition - Gerardus Blokdyk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Is Supporting Cloud Management Platforms documentation required?  What is our formula for success in Cloud Management Platforms ?  Which individuals, teams or departments will be involved in Cloud Management Platforms?  How likely is the current Cloud Management Platforms plan to come in on schedule or on budget?  Does Cloud Management Platforms systematically track and analyze outcomes for accountability and quality improvement?  
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Defining, designing, creating, and implementing a process to solve a business challenge or meet a business objective is the most valuable role… In EVERY company, organization and department.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Unless you are talking a one-time, single-use project within a business, there should be a process. Whether that process is managed and implemented by humans, AI, or a combination of the two, it needs to be designed by someone with a complex enough perspective to ask the right questions. Someone capable of asking the right questions and step back and say, &#39;What are we really trying to accomplish here? And is there a different way to look at it?&#39;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This Self-Assessment empowers people to do just that - whether their title is entrepreneur, manager, consultant, (Vice-)President, CxO etc... - they are the people who rule the future. They are the person who asks the right questions to make Cloud Management Platforms investments work better.
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;
