  <title>The Marketing Audit - Orlando Skelton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Auditing the marketing function within your organization is the hidden link between long-term customer engagement and sustainable revenue growth.  In this book, we provide a questionnaire consisting of 50 questions that will allow you to align your marketing activities with the dynamic needs of your customers.  If you do not know the answers to these questions, customer value is eroding, and you are losing business (and perhaps not even aware of the lost opportunities)!    For example, do you know how your customers make their buying decisions and who or what sources of information they use in their decision-making? Can you identify the top three issues your customer is facing right now? Finally, do you &quot;really&quot; know how your customers feel about your products or services vs. your competitors?  For more business critical questions, this book is a must have. This book is a small investment with a huge (and real) return." />
