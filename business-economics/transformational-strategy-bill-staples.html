  <title>Transformational Strategy - Bill Staples</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Tried and tested practical wisdom about participatory, long range and strategic planning.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In rapidly changing, complex landscapes organization leaders need concrete plans not simplistic advice. Reactive plans often entrench the problem. But when many minds focus together a new array of ideas and options can generate profound insight, creative strategy and high resolve in the whole group. What can leaders, consultants and facilitators do to ensure this happens?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As a master practitioner of ICAs Technology of Participation (ToPTM) Bill Staples fully illustrates the breadth and depth of the transformation that comes from fully engaging people in the decisions that affect their work and lives. This book pulls back the veil on todays most powerful facilitation and reveals transformational philosophy, methods and tools used around the world. ToP practitioners will especially benefit from the case studies and detailed procedures that launch organizational transformation.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There are few organizations that have contributed so much to the improvement of group problem solving and decision-making as the Institute of Cultural Affairs. Over the past 25 years, its Technology of Participation has become known the world over and is applied in every sector of society. This book provides a thorough introduction to ToP including its background, purpose, methods, and applications. Bill Staples integrates and presents this information in a way that makes it accessible to anyone concerned with engaging people in effective problem solving and decision-making.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Sandy Schuman, author of Creating a Culture of Collaboration: The International Association of Facilitators Handbook and The Handbook for Working with Difficult Groups: How They Are Difficult, Why They Are Difficult and What You Can Do About It&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;ICA is truly one of the pioneers of the participatory approach to planning and deliberation. Its commitment to participatory, democratic values is authentic and trustworthy.&lt;/P&gt;
