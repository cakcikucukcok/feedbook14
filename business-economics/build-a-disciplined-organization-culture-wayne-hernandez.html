  <title>Build a  Disciplined  Organization Culture - Wayne Hernandez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you want DISCIPLINED Employees thinking DISCIPLINED Thoughts and taking DISCIPLINED Actions then this book will assist you in accomplishing your goal. MissionWonTM is the methodology that will focus your entire organization on the details that will assure your Mission is accomplished in as short a time frame and as least complicated as possible. You will address in detail all pieces that insure accomplishment of your entire Mission. This process will address the fact that not only upper management is aware of what is going on at all times but also that all employees know what they are supposed to be working on and why. They are also made aware that they have input and take ownership to insure that the company Mission is accomplished. It can be used in the smallest organization to the largest. One major company increased profits over $14 million per year and serviced their customers 2.5 times as quickly using this method with only 150 employees of their 4,000. The group using this also had ONE-Half of its Vice Presidents accomplishments for the year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After you finish reading this book, think about how by using this method you will have a major impact on your organization and its success. Other than in private industry, also think about the impact on our nation if our Federal, State, and Local governments used it. It can also be used to guide your personal life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For more information go to http://www.missionwon.net." />
