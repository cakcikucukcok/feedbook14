  <title>The Cotton Story - Cheng Woi Tan, Pamela Nowicka</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Most of us have no idea how the things we use every day are produced. From food, to electronic goods to the clothes we wear. In a global society of conspicuous consumption, the fundamentals are hidden or ignored.
The Cotton Story shows how cotton is produced and the impacts of this on ourselves, farmers, and the planet. 
Many people worry about cancer but are unaware that carcinogenic chemicals are used in cotton production...and are impossible to completely remove from the fibres.
Many people dont like the idea of genetically modified (GM) plants, and yet dont know that most cotton is GM...even in the food we eat.
Organic cotton is better for our bodies, the farmers and the environment. Unlike chemical cotton, it is not subsidised with millions of dollars from governments and agrichemical giants like Monsanto.
As consumers we have a responsibility to cause the least possible harm to the precious, fragile planet we share with so many other living beings.
The Cotton Story shows how our purchases can harm ourselves, other people and the planet...or not.
We dedicate this book to the farmers and garment workers whose lives were stolen in the production of garments.
And to the countless animals, birds, insects and other beings who are destroyed in the name of consumerism.
The choice is ours. To shop ethically or not.
We hope The Cotton Story will help you make better choices." />
