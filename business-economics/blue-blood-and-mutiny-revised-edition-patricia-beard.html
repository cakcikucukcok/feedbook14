  <title>Blue Blood and Mutiny Revised Edition - Patricia Beard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inside story of the power struggle that rocked Wall Street&#39;s most prestigious financial institution&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What began with a shot over the bow ended in a shocking coup d&#39;etat. In less than four months a group of eight retired executives orchestrated a stunning revolt within Morgan Stanley, the venerable and&amp;#8212;until recently&amp;#8212;most successful financial services firm on Wall Street. Now acclaimed journalist and historian Patricia Beard brings together the entire behind-the-scenes story in &lt;em&gt;Blue Blood and Mutiny&lt;/em&gt;, a real-life business thriller exposing the tale that shook high finance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 2005 the business world woke up to an unprecedented full-page ad in the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; calling for the removal of Morgan Stanley&#39;s CEO. It was paid for by a cohort of eight former Morgan Stanley executives, including an ex-chairman and an ex-president, who soon would be dubbed the &quot;Eight Grumpy Old Men.&quot; Their target was CEO Philip Purcell, a midwesterner who had come to power following Morgan Stanley&#39;s 1997 merger with Dean Witter Discover, where Purcell had been chief executive. In his eight years as CEO, Purcell had presided over a 50 percent decline in stock price since its peak in 2000 and a series of high-profile government and civil lawsuits that had tarnished the company&#39;s once-sterling reputation. Just a few months after the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; ad, Purcell would retire under pressure, and former president John Mack, who had been pushed out by Purcell, was appointed CEO. The &quot;Eight Grumpy Old Men&quot; won the battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The revolt of the Eight is about more than the stock price, or any bottom-line metrics: it signals a clash of cultures and a battle for the soul of American business. Since its founding, Morgan Stanley has been an elite enterprise guided by J. P. Morgan Jr.&#39;s motto &quot;A First Class Business in a First Class Way.&quot; The House of Morgan stood for something larger than success with honor; its ethos was unique&amp;#8212;some would say sacred&amp;#8212;and the eight retired executives believed this ideal had been undermined during Purcell&#39;s reign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opening the long-closed doors of a bastion of Wall Street that has maintained the strictest privacy until now, &lt;em&gt;Blue Blood and Mutiny&lt;/em&gt; weaves the history of Morgan Stanley with the inside story of the fight for dominance between two competing business cultures&amp;#8212;one, the collegial meritocracy handed down from the days of J. P. Morgan, and the other, a cold, contemporary corporate model. Here is the season&#39;s must-read book for anyone who wants to understand the future of American business.&lt;/p&gt;" />
