  <title>Leading High Performers: The Ultimate Guide to Being a Fast, Fluid, and Flexible Leader - Eric Snow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Basketball demands a level of leadership that can consistently create teams with both personal responsibility and the autonomy to make split-second decisions in incredibly high-stakes situations.  Does this sound familiar?  Well it should this is the current environment for corporate, political, nonprofit, and educational leadership! In LEADING HIGH PERFORMERS, Snow develops his experience on the court into a formula to help corporate and organizational leaders understand how to get their high performers, MVP&#39;s, and top new recruits to perform better and follow their leadership.  Because like basketball players today&#39;s organization leaders must be &quot;fast, fluid, and flexible&quot; to be successful, these new times, demand new leaders. Throughout the book, Snow examines the most crucial aspects of leadership development, including: The secrets of self-confidence, The keys to powerful communication, Tips for managing conflict,  And...Methods of obtaining peak performance from yourself and those around you Snow also frequently breaks away from his own lessons to bring readers the thoughts on leadership of some of the high-profile coaches and teammates throughout his college and pro careers, including Larry Brown, LeBron James, Tom Izzo, Allen Iverson, Nate McMillan and Jud Heathcote. Snow understands what it is like to be the new guy on the team, thrust into leadership the first day on the job and charged with leading legends of the game. It&#39;s not as simple as pointing in the right direction and expecting everyone to follow with a high-five and no ulterior motives. High performers have high expectations, high skill levels and high egos that must be catered to rather than ignored. It can be a job within a job leading these rock stars to winning results and woe to those who are unprepared." />
