  <title>Success in the Child Care Business - Vincent Gabriel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a guide specially written for Singapore business people who wish to start and operate a child care centre in Singapore. The Singapore government has initiated to have 200 day care centres to be built from 2013 to 2017 to enable women to work in Singapore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the same time, the flow of household help could tail off as supplier countries like Indonesia, the Philippines experience a surge in economic activity and job creation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Locals need to get into this business with a mindset that the exhaustive operating and staffing conditions of MSFD are meant to lay out the rules for operators and their customers. Child care in this light is more than a convenience it has become an economic necessity if working women are to find their place in the world of work and in the professions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you think there is money to be made in the child care business, this is the book for you." />
