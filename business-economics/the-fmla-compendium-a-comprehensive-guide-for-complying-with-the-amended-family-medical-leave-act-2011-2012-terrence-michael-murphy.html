  <title>The Fmla Compendium, a Comprehensive Guide for Complying with the Amended Family &amp; Medical Leave Act 2011-2012 - Terrence Michael Murphy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The FMLA Compendium is a comprehensive guide for complying with the Family and Medical Leave Act As Amended 2011-2012. When thinking about and addressing the impact of the FMLA on Human Resources and Business Management this much is clear:  There is only one constant in the FMLA and that is.. It Never Stays The Same.
Court Interpretations alter our understanding of the law. Often the FMLA is amended.  Many times its complex terminology and acompanying requirements are re-interpreted and revised.  Sometimes these changes are made by the Courts, sometimes by the Congress, and sometimes by Bureaucrats.  No matter what the source of these changes, what we know for certain is.. the FMLA does change and we have to comply with the law, changes and all.
The FMLA Compendium is designed and written to be the most reliable source, and a must have guide, for employers, human resources professionals; business consultants; service providers to employers; educators; executives; middle and first line managers and supervisors; and all others involved with managing &quot;employment&quot; in today&#39;s complex legal enviornment." />
