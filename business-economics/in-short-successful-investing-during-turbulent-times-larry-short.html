  <title>In Short: Successful Investing During Turbulent Times - Larry Short</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Investors are increasingly frustrated by poor investment returns, particularly in the last decade. It seems the financial world wrenches from one crisis to another in a boom-bust, bubble and crash sequence, rising to unpredictable heights and falling to unfathomable depths.The old investing rules do not seem to work. Something has changed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book recommends that the reader take an alternative mindset to investing. It guides the reader to this mindset through a series of educational and, hopefully, entertaining lessons. It uses various tools such as newspaper headlines at critical points in the history of the markets as well as insightful anecdotes gathered over the years. It also employs often amusing research from outside the industry to shed light on how investors make decisions.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This book examines the origins of accepted investment methodology, provides a  critical review of mutual funds, and presents alternative solutions for these turbulent times.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Along the way it also touches on the future of the investment industry, how to select an investment advisor, and an alternative way to plan for the future.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In Short: Many books tell you about what investments are. This book is an attempt to teach you about how to drive your investment returns higher.&lt;/P&gt;" />
