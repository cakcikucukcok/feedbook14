  <title>Re-Creating the Corporation: A Design of Organizations for the 21st Century - Russell L. Ackoff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Over the last three decades the average life expectancy of a corporation in North America has dipped well below 20 years.  In fact, by 1983 a full third of the 1970 Fortune 500 companies had been acquired, merged, or broken apart. In this landmark book, one of the business world&#39;s foremost pioneers, Russell L. Ackoff, delivers this indispensable guide for those hoping to beat these odds--and to better navigate the corporate challenges of the next millennium.
     While most business and management schools continue to teach the functions of a corporation separately--production, marketing, finance, personnel--the reality is that for a corporation to endure each division must work with the others to create an effective system. Re-Creating the Corporation is Ackoff&#39;s masterful blueprint for understanding and creating these model corporate systems. In four comprehensive sections--Background, Process, Designs, and Change--Ackoff lays out in clear concise prose the five organizational goals of successful corporate systems: plan effectively, learn and adapt rapidly, democratize, introduce internal market economies, and employ a flexible structure that will minimize the need for future restructuring. And through a deft mix of practical and theoretical examples drawn from a wide range of applications in a wide range of firms, this book ultimately guides executives to the system best suited to meet their organizational goals.
      Re-Creating the Corporation, which is the culmination of a lifetime of innovative and insightful business thought from one of the business world&#39;s premier thinkers, is essential reading for those attempting to navigate the rapidly changing economic environment of the next millennium." />
