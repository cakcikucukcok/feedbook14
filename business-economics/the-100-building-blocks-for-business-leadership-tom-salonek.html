      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;More than half of all small businesses fail within the first five years. Starting and running a small business is hard work, and many entrepreneurs feel they must do whatever it takes to succeed, at the expense of their family, friends, and health. Yet, if done correctly, small-business ownership can&amp;mdash;and should&amp;mdash;balance profitable operations with personal fulfillment. According to author Tom Salonek&amp;mdash;founder and CEO of Intertech, a Minnesota-based technology consulting and training firm&amp;mdash;this balance is actually the secret to success.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Salonek believes that your business should &quot;give life, not take it,&quot; a philosophy that has helped him grow his own venture every year since its inception in 1991. In &lt;I&gt;The 100&lt;/I&gt;, Salonek shares his secrets to business success in the form of 100 concise, nuts-and-bolts lessons for achieving the ideal work-life balance for maximum success.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Written in clear, direct prose, these lessons are packed with actionable ideas and practical advice for using communication, collaboration, and technology to help small-business owners cultivate the best qualities not only in themselves, but in their employees as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Whether you own your own business or are simply thinking of starting one, this book will help you inspire teamwork, meet client expectations, clarify your personal values, and create a company culture to match. In addition, readers will gain access to a plethora of downloadable online resources&amp;mdash;checklists, worksheets, templates, and more&amp;mdash;to help implement the book&amp;#8217;s ideas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;The 100&lt;/I&gt; is a handy, inspiring addition to any business manager&amp;#8217;s home library.&lt;/div&gt;" />
