  <title>Leadership, Eh? - Murray R. Janewski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ernie is back at it again! This time it is all about Leadership, Eh? Murray Janewski picks up where his father, Bill, left off in The Travels of Ernie, and puts a twist into common leadership situations that will make you laugh and learn. Ernie had to travel many places and meet with many people to be able to bring you these life lessons. Hes a lovable character who will challenge your thinking about leadership while making you laugh out loud. 
Murray Janewski is a leader and a thinker. His book, Leadership, Eh?, looks at the lighter side and the winning side of this delicate process. His original insights will have you laughing, learning, and leading.
-Jeffrey Gitomer, author of The Little Red Book of Selling
As the famous journalist William Davis said, The kind of humor I like is the kind that makes me laugh for five seconds and think for ten minutes. One of the key challenges of inspiring leadership is combining vision, compassion, and strength. Leadership, Eh? consolidates years of experience into a fun and friendly collection of wisdom all leaders can use.
-John Tikkanen, President, Bredero Shaw, Houston, TX
A well-written, essential read for the person who wants to make a difference in their company; from the frontline worker down to the CEO.
-Matt Kenna, V.P. Manufacturing, Alkhorayef Petroleum, Saudi Arabia
We should all be so lucky to have an Ernie in our life. It is not too often we find smart, witty, funny, practical, and soul all wrapped up in one package. It is easy to read the book and feel like you were having a conversation with Ernie, over a cup of coffee or on the back porch over a cold beer. Ernie is the guy to go to when you need to clear away from the confusion of life and just have someone tell you like it is.
