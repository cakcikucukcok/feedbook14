  <title>How to Acquire Money Riches and Wealth - Floyd M. Chitalu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Knowledge of how to acquire money riches and wealth has unlimited domain of validity, but this obvious truth which is a common sense is not always common to many people and this observation is non-trivial. This is the very reason why I have written this book to help make it clearer for anyone to decipher how few people who are rich ever got it right.
Anyone, utterly anyone with the zeal for self enrichment can acquire lots of money, riches and wealth because it is not the size of the dog in the fight but the size of the fight in the dog that matters. It is you, yourself, who can acquire lots of money, riches and wealth and never let it to someone else, because they will let you down! So, learn from this book the facts of life and living that I have presented and with your instinctive belief in yourself you will invoke in you the zeal to acquire money, riches and wealth. 
There is a right way to follow if you want to acquire the money, riches and wealth that you desire. The right way will empower you to become a millionaire, billionaire or trillionaire and live your life to higher level of self actualisation and you will join the list of rich people in your village, town, city, country or in the world. You can turn things round from despair to prosperity and you can climb up to your desired highest level of your financial, economic and social status in your society only with your unshakeable belief in yourself." />
