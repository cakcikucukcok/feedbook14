  <title>Small-Business Loan Request Guide - Ted Nichols</title>
      <meta name="description" content="BOOK DESCRIPTION
         The majority of small businesses are under capitalized with limited sources of capital. Banks are an important source of financing for a small business. The SMALL BUSINESS LOAN REQUEST GUIDE will help the small business owner prepare a lender-friendly loan request presentation that will cause the banker to have a good impression of the business and the owners skills and experience. Good preparation is the key to success when applying for a loan. The owners preparation should include evaluating the financial needs of the business and focusing upon the amount and type of loan that could be the solution. The guide will assist the owner in this effort.  The guide will help the small business owner become familiar with the bankers primary issues in their assessment of the loan request. It will also help the owner anticipate questions that the banker is likely to ask. The guide contains samples that would be considered a good presentation by a bank lender. This is a how-to guide that will increase the business owners confidence and effectiveness in the loan process and help get the owner and banker on the same page. The guide can be a continuing resource for the owner to use during the life of the business." />
