  <title>The future of banking (Flash Ensayo) - Miguel Á. Fernández Ordóñez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;A reflection on the fragile banking sector nowadays and the  possibility of progressing towards a system of public and safe money, issued by the Central Bank.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Miguel A. Fernández Ordóñez introduces his text with a quote from Mervyn  King, former governor of the Bank of England: «Among all ways of  organizing the banking system, the one that we have today is the worst.»&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Ordóñez shares his opinion and he proposes a radical change within the  banking system: a Central Bank which would be the only one authorized to  create money. His reform would allow families and companies to deposit  their money in the Central Bank, something that exclusively private  banks do today. Thus, only real money would be employed, far away from  the «fictive money» or «promise to give back money» that we are used to  nowadays. Fernández Ordóñez claims that by doing so, financial and  economic crises could be avoided, such as the one which Spain suffered  from2008 onwards. Banks would not need to be rescued with huge amounts  of public money. Through this new model that the author proposes, everything would be reformulated: the Central Bank would be an  autonomous system, far from the control of political powers, and private  banks would transform into very different companies. The Government  would not be in need of investing public money to save banks, and the  society would head towards a more equal and safe economic system.&lt;/P&gt;" />
