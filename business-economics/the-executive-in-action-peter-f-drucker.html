  <title>The Executive in Action - Peter F. Drucker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Three complete Drucker management books in one volume &amp;#8212; &lt;em&gt;Managing for Results, Innovation and Entrepreneurship,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Effective Executive&lt;/em&gt; with a new preface by the author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his preface, Peter F. Drucker says: &amp;#34;These three books should enable executives &amp;#8212; whether high up in the organization or just beginning their career&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8212; to know the right things to do;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8212; to know how to do them; and&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8212; to do them effectively.Together, these three books provide &lt;em&gt;The Toolkit for Executive Action.&amp;#34;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drucker identifies and explains the practices, decisions and priorities for achieving business performance and executive effectiveness. These books cover &amp;#34;the three dimensions of the successful practice of management.&amp;#34; &lt;em&gt;Managing for Results&lt;/em&gt; was the first book to explain business strategy. Drucker shows how the existing business has to focus on opportunities rather than problems to be effective, for it is the opportunities that will bring growth and performance. &lt;em&gt;Innovation and Entrepreneurship&lt;/em&gt; analyzes the challenges and opportunities of America&amp;#39;s new entrepreneurial economy. It is a superbly practical book that explains what established businesses, public service institutions and new ventures have to know, learn and do to prepare and create the successful businesses of tomorrow. In &lt;em&gt;The Effective Executive,&lt;/em&gt; Drucker discusses the five practices and habits that must be learned for executive effectiveness. Ranging widely through business and government, he demonstrates the distinctive skill of the executive and offers fresh insights into old and seemingly obvious situations. Together, these three books have sold more than a million copies; they have been published throughout the world and continue to sell actively. These are essential works for the executive and manager by &amp;#34;the dean of this country&amp;#39;s business and management philosophers.&amp;#34; &amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
