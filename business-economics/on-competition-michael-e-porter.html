  <title>On Competition - Michael E. Porter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;For the past two decades, Michael Porter&#39;s work has towered over the field of competitive strategy. &lt;EM&gt;On Competition, Updated and Expanded Edition&lt;/EM&gt; brings together more than a dozen of Porter&#39;s landmark articles from the &lt;EM&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/EM&gt;. Five are new to this edition, including the 2008 update to his classic &quot;The Five Competitive Forces That Shape Strategy,&quot; as well as new work on health care, philanthropy, corporate social responsibility, and CEO leadership. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This collection captures Porter&#39;s unique ability to bridge theory and practice. Each of the articles has not only shaped thinking, but also redefined the work of practitioners in its respective field. In an insightful new introduction, Porter relates each article to the whole of his thinking about competition and value creation, and traces how that thinking has deepened over time. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This collection is organized by topic, allowing the reader easy access to the wide range of Porter&#39;s work. Parts I and II present the frameworks for which Porter is best known--frameworks that address how companies, as well as nations and regions, gain and sustain competitive advantage. Part III shows how strategic thinking can address society&#39;s most pressing challenges, from environmental sustainability to improving health-care delivery. Part IV explores how both nonprofits and corporations can create value for society more effectively by applying strategy principles to philanthropy. Part V explores the link between strategy and leadership.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
