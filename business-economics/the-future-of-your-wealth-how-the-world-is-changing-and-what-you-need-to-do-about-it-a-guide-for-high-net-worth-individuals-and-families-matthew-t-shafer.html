  <title>The Future of Your Wealth: How the World Is Changing and What You Need to Do about It: A Guide for High Net Worth Individuals and Families - Matthew T. Shafer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="No one would deny that wealthy families face new and unique challenges that can make planning for the future more difficult than ever before. A byzantine U.S. tax code, increasingly complex global markets, and a growing cultural disdain for the &quot;wealthy&quot; pose new threats to the American investor. In this clear-sighted and urgent guide to managing your wealth, Matthew Shafer calls on his years of advising experience and his background as an economist to chart a new course toward financial success and peace of mind. Shafer outlines how new investment strategies based on cutting-edge analytics and behavioral finance can help you navigate today&#39;s uncertain economic terrain and harness the mass psychology that drives market trends. Armed with a resilient outlook and an economist&#39;s insight into the future, Shafer argues that the road ahead is not all doom and gloom-in fact; there are good reasons to be very optimistic about the future of your wealth. In April, Matt and The Future of Your Wealth was featured in the USA Today article, Seven Big Mistakes Couples Make in Retirement." />
