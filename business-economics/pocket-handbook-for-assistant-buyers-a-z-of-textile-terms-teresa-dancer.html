  <title>Pocket Handbook for Assistant Buyers: A - Z of Textile Terms - Teresa Dancer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Teresa Dancer realised whilst teaching students at the London College of Fashion that they could benefit from a concise handbook that would better prepare them for a career in the industry.   Whether it was defining cup seaming, knowing the difference between weft and warp yarns, understanding where indigo dyes come from, or grasping what a micron count is, she found that students were lacking in knowledge which would help them progress in the industry.   With detailed explanations for each term and photos to make learning easier, it&#39;s more than a fashion dictionary; it&#39;s an essential tool for anyone seeking to enter the world of fashion, particularly buyers and those involved in product development.   The handbook helps students and aspiring buyers break into this competitive world and it provides the necessary confidence to work with suppliers and manufacturers on a variety of different products and textile bases." />
