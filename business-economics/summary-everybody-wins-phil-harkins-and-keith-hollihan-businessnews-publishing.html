  <title>Summary: Everybody Wins - Phil Harkins and Keith Hollihan - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book “EVERYBODY WINS: The Story and Lessons Behind RE/MAX” by Phil Harkins and Keith Hollihan.“From the beginning, my dream was to grow the best and the largest real estate network in the world, an organization where everybody wins – our customers, our agents, our owners, our employees, everybody. It took more than 30 years, but that dream has become a reality.” (Dave Liniger)In 1972, Dave Liniger was working in the largest real estate company in Denver, Colorado. He approached his boss with an idea: he wanted to start a new real estate company which would get away from the way the industry was structured and introduce a new business model altogether. Since then, RE/MAX has grown into one of the largest real estate networks in the world. Coauthors Phil Harkins and Keith Hollihan analyze how this company has achieved such incredible success. Based on financial information and extensive research in RE/MAX files, this outstanding case study represents a model of innovation, constant improvement, determination and passion. A must read for all managers seeking to turn vision into action." />
