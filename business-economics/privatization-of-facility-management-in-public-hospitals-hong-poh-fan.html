  <title>Privatization of Facility Management in Public Hospitals - Hong Poh Fan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Malaysian economy has gone from the doldrums to being a juggernaut, which has posed many challenges to the health care industryespecially hospitals.
Public hospitals in Malaysia have faced an uphill task in upgrading health care services to levels compatible with international standards. In this book, Hong Poh Fan, a senior adviser on facility management for a hospital developer, explores the transition that public hospitals have undertaken with the support of the private sector.
The author zeroes in on critical issues, including:
	successes and challenges of privatization implementation;
	hospital experiences in a Southeast Asian context and how those experiences can be applied elsewhere; and
	ways that private development of hospitals has changed over time as well as the rationale of privatization.
When people think of what the hospital industry needs, they often focus on having enough doctors and nurses, but when facilities management is lacking, services can be compromised no matter how employees are working at a facility.
