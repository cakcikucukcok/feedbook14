  <title>Sell Now! - John R. Talbott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How Far Can Home Prices Fall?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;What Can You Do to Protect Yourself?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Home prices are seriously overvalued in many regions of the United States. The question is no longer &lt;i&gt;if,&lt;/i&gt; but rather &lt;i&gt;how far,&lt;/i&gt; home prices will fall and over what time frame this bubble will deflate. Home values have been escalating in real terms since 1981, the year nominal interest rates last peaked. And the greatest price increases in percentage terms have been in the wealthiest and most exclusive cities in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sell Now!&lt;/i&gt; analyses the evidence and offers clear explanations of these perplexing issues. Overly aggressive mortgage lenders have fueled this overheated market by extending too much credit to home buyers and by offering ever-more exotic forms of mortgages. Many home buyers have been caught in a never-ending race to achieve status, often overpaying for homes in the &quot;right&quot; neighborhoods. And people&#39;s pursuit of easy profits has pushed prices to unsustainable levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is a reasoned analysis that not only explains how home prices got this high, but why they are sure to fall and by what amount. &lt;i&gt;Sell Now!&lt;/i&gt; debunks many theories that purport to show that home prices are either reasonable or are sustainable at their &lt;br&gt;current high levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How bad can it get? Unlike previous home-price declines, this cycle has the potential to be not only national, but international in scope. The national economy, so dependent on the housing, mortgage, real estate, banking, and construction industries for growth, is at risk and the entire banking system might come under fire. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You owe it to yourself to become better informed about the possible impact on you, your family and your most important asset---your home.&lt;/p&gt;" />
