  <title>On the Trail of Homo Economicus - Gordon Brady, Robert D. Tollison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This collection of previously unpublished expository writings by Gordon Tullock on themes ranging from game theory, externalities, public choice, rent-seeking, law and economics, and economic progress is representative of the breadth of Tullock&#39;s career. As co-founder of Public Choice, Tullock has been a major contributor to our understanding of the logic of collective choice and the politics of collective action. Tullock&#39;s insights have helped establish the unambiguous message that political, social, and economic institutions affect individual behavior whether in economics or political markets. Tullock&#39;s hypotheses, proposed laws, and paradoxes have shaped the development of public choice, as well as charting new areas in law, economics, and sociobiology.&lt;br /&gt;In sorting through Tullock&#39;s personal papers, the editors learned and here present the many dimensions of the man and the breadth of his interests. From the papers, we can piece together much of Tullock&#39;s personal history. For example, there are myths surrounding Gordon Tullock that can be laid to rest: his birthplace, the lack of a baccalaureate degree, the &quot;one&quot; course that marks his formal training in economics, and his career prior to his academic emergence in the mid-1950s." />
