  <title>Billionaire Boyfriend - J.l. Ryan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Book 1 - The Billionaire&amp;#39;s Secret&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Frantic and broke, plus size Amelia Randolph is livid because her grandmother is sick in the hospital again. She knows it&amp;#39;s because of the new water filtration system that was installed in her home by that cocky billionaire Jacob Montgomery&amp;#39;s company. The water was tainted with toxic chemicals, and now, the woman who raised her might die.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When Amelia finally confronts charismatic Jacob at his office, she has to hold herself back from scratching his eyes out. She doesn&amp;#39;t want to come off as a crazy person because he might not take her seriously.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After spending a few minutes with him, she realizes something. He&amp;#39;s not the cocky SOB she imagined he would be. In fact, he&amp;#39;s not even overly confident or arrogant. He&amp;#39;s just seems stressed out because since word got out that his water filtration system is causing the release of dangerous chemicals, his phone hasn&amp;#39;t stopped ringing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There&amp;#39;s something about expensive tailored suits that make a man. They&amp;#39;re one of the many luxuries he enjoyed as a CEO. She wasn&amp;#39;t there to flirt with some rich guy, but she couldn&amp;#39;t take her eyes off him. She felt guilty, really. Her grandmother was sick in the hospital and it was all his fault. How could she be fantasizing about what he looks like naked?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She&amp;#39;s all spunk and curves. Lots and lots of curves. At almost 100 pounds overweight, broke, and desperate for a baby, Amelia isn&amp;#39;t anyone&amp;#39;s idea of a good catch, let alone a gorgeous billionaire&amp;#39;s.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To make a long story short, there&amp;#39;s something about her that Jacob can&amp;#39;t resist. She&amp;#39;s not like the skinny models he&amp;#39;s used to dating, but he can&amp;#39;t get her out of his mind for some reason. Is he really falling for curvy girl Amelia or is he just trying to cozy up to her so that she doesn&amp;#39;t sue him for every penny he&amp;#39;s got and ruin his water filtration business?&lt;br /&gt;
