          &lt;strong&gt;How Santa Gets His Christmas Spirit Back…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;James Claussen has played Santa for years, but now that he&#39;s a widower, he&#39;s lost interest – in everything. So his daughter, Brooke, kidnaps him from the mall (in his Santa suit!) and takes him to Icicle Falls. She&#39;s arranged a special Christmas at the lodge owned by long-widowed Olivia Wallace and her son, Eric. And yet…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Brooke wants Dad to be happy, but she&#39;s not ready to see someone else&#39;s mommy kissing Santa Claus. Single mum Missy Monroe brings her kids to the lodge, too. Lalla wants a grandma for Christmas, and her brother, Carlos, wants a dog. Missy can&#39;t provide either one. What she&#39;d like is an attractive, dependable man. A man like John Truman… But John&#39;s girlfriend will be joining him in Icicle Falls, and he&#39;s going to propose.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Of course, not everything goes as planned. But sometimes the best gifts are the ones you don&#39;t expect!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Welcome to Icicle Falls, the town that will warm your heart.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Praise for Sheila Roberts&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&#39;Sheila Roberts makes me laugh. I read her books &amp; come away hopeful and happy.&#39; - bestselling romance author &lt;strong&gt;Debbie Macomber&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&#39;&lt;strong&gt;perfectly captures the charm and cheer of the holiday season&lt;/strong&gt;’ - Booklist&lt;/p&gt;
