  <title>Spirited Me - Lilah Baker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Boris could not resist anymore. He said, Enough already, then reached out and pulled Cecile into his arms. She held on to him, and he could feel her heart beating erratically in her chest, as was his. God, she felt good in his arms. He smiled down at her, ignoring her coworkers, whose mouths were gaped open in surprise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the day she had told him about her tragedy, he realized how much he wanted to hold her in his arms and comfort her, how much she had come to mean to him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time they had ran into each other in the hallway and he had stood towering over her and she had listened to him so intently, she seemed oblivious to all the others as they passed. He had leaned down so closely to her and he wanted to kiss her so badly it ached. He knew she had felt it too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cecile was shocked that he would be so bold! And she loved it. She felt bereft when the elevator opened and he released her. One of her male coworkers said, I believe that he just staked his clam, Cecile.&lt;/p&gt;" />
