  <title>Almost Forgotten - Carey Decevito, Clarise Tan, Eric David Battershell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jake had it all: money, women, and great looks. He was happy. Well, he thought he was.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then, a series of women and a ghost from his past made him re-evaluate everything.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Why had she come back? Why was she standing in his firm&amp;#39;s boardroom with his opposing counsel? And the burning question - why did he give a damn after fifteen years?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She had broken his heart all those years ago, and Jake chose to live the life of a bachelor from there on out. Along with his fast-paced career, he maintained a fast-paced social life. It&amp;#39;s what worked for him. At least he&amp;#39;d convinced himself it did.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The loneliness of his large home the minute the housekeeper clocked-out and the women warming his bed deserted him left him wanting. Could he get what so many of his friends already had: the woman, the family, the house with the white picket fence? Maybe. But just because he desired those things, things he&amp;#39;d sworn off ages ago, doesn&amp;#39;t mean they were destined for him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One thing was for sure; with Danica back in town, Jake&amp;#39;s life was never going to be the same again...&lt;/p&gt;" />
