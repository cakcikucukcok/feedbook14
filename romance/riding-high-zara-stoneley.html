  <title>Riding High - Zara Stoneley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHE&#39;S IN FOR THE RIDE OF HER LIFE...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; He never let himself be ruled by desire, and yet the minute Roisin Grant looked at him, Saul knew he had to have her. It didn&#39;t matter that her equestrian business was struggling or that he was there to collect on a mountain of debt-all that mattered was the way she responded to his touch as if she were coming alive for the first time in years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One night with Roisin isn&#39;t enough. One year wouldn&#39;t be enough. Determined to keep Roisin in his life and in his bed, Saul makes an offer he knows she can&#39;t refuse: either walk away from the stables and the life she&#39;s always known, or consider her debt paid in full by delivering an altogether different kind of riding lesson...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ms. Stoneley definitely knows how to write chemistry. These two had it in spades. They couldn&#39;t keep their hands off each other.&quot;-&lt;em&gt;All Romance All the Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What readers are saying:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; &quot;Super sexy and highly erotic... It is a fast-paced story that will set your eReader on fire.&quot;&lt;br&gt; &quot;This book was brilliant.
