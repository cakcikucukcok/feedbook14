          &lt;strong&gt;Who is the real Joanna Barnes?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To Matt Sinclair, Joanna Barnes was the woman his father married six months after his mother died. Two years later, his father had been on the verge of divorcing Joanna when he&#39;d suffered a heart attack. Most of his assets were gone–and several important papers were missing.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To Kate Reilly, Joanna Barnes was the woman who&#39;d befriended her one summer when she&#39;d been an unhappy 11 year old. The woman who&#39;d sent Kate a birthday card each year with a reminder that the two of them would meet on Kate&#39;s 30th birthday. A meeting Joanna doesn&#39;t make.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Then Kate reads Joanna&#39;s obituary in the paper. The police are calling her death a suicide. Kate insists that Joanna would never have broken her promise. Matt&#39;s not so sure.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But Kate and Matt put aside their differences as they uncover a world of intrigue, betrayal, and danger. Gradually the summer of Joanna becomes the summer of Kate and Matt….&lt;/p&gt;
