  <title>A Black Lady and Her Slave - Richard Dee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For adults only. This is the fourth book by the author. The Pampered Black
Queen; Lady Skyy; Submissive In the Suburbs; and A Black Lady and
Her Slave all probe relationships involving S&amp;M play between a dominant
female partner and a male sub. A Black Lady and Her Slave is the third
book featuring the beautiful Lady Skyy as she enjoys her life of leisure with
a male slave who struggles to fulfi ll her every wish and whim and satisfy
her every desire no matter how decadent or demanding it may be. Spare
the rod or the whip and spoil the slave is a completely alien concept to
the beautiful dominatrix. Whips, chains, clamps, restraints and electrical
devices spice up their play, sometimes to excess, and keep the lovely lady
from becoming bored with her pampered, lazy life style. In this edition
she fi nds herself in a position to share her property with friends, even as
Miss Brandie had shared him with her in the beginning. Their unique
relationship will, however, be tried and tested and strained. As usual, with
the Lady Skyy, the sex is graphic and intense and is intended primarily for
her own gratifi cation. Do not read this if you do not have an open mind." />
