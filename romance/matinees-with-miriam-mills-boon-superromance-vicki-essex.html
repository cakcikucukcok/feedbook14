  <title>Matinees With Miriam (Mills &amp; Boon Superromance) - Vicki Essex</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;Having his heart stolen wasn&#39;t part of the plan!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Shane Patel has a way with people—a skill that&#39;s made him a success in the condo development business. But his charms are proving useless on Miriam Bateman. The Crown Theater is the key to his company&#39;s latest project. It also happens to be Miriam&#39;s home and her grandfather&#39;s legacy. She&#39;s made it clear that it&#39;s not for sale.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Despite the frustration, Shane&#39;s enjoying trying to win Miriam over. And the best part of his day becomes watching old movies with her. When Miriam&#39;s plans to reopen the theater threaten his project, though, Shane has a tough decision to make: his career or Miriam.&lt;/p&gt;
