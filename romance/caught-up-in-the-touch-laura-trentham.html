  <title>Caught Up in the Touch - Laura Trentham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jessica Montgomery has always lived by three simple rules: stay calm, stay professional, stay in control. Working tirelessly to make it into the executive ranks of her family&#39;s business, her dream job of CFO is within reach-if she can convince one stubborn and sexy restaurateur to take her offer and manage Montgomery Industries&#39; flagship restaurant in Atlanta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the surface Logan Wilde is all good-old-boy charm and humor, but he can&#39;t seem to outrun the hell-raising reputation of his high school years. Although he has thought about leaving his hometown in Falcon, Alabama, he has grown to love the town, his restaurant, and his part-time gig coaching the football team. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jessica estimates it will take a week tops to get Logan Wilde&#39;s signature on her generous offer, but their first meeting is anything but professional. Logan shreds Jessica&#39;s control and unleashes a passion she didn&#39;t know existed even as a deeper connection between them takes root. When her family&#39;s manipulations threaten to tear them apart, Jessica has to decide whether her dream is really the CFO job or the man who has unselfishly offered his love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
