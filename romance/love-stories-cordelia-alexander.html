  <title>Love Stories - Cordelia Alexander</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Love Stories the Relationships of four Women is my first book.  I love it!  It was not what I had in mind when I sat down at Letha, my nieces kitchen table to write.  When I put my fingers to the keys of my second hand computer back in 2006, the book that I had planned to write was about my trials and tribulations during the death of my boys.   This book is a Romance novel about four girlfriends and their relationships.  On these pages you will experience the Love, Laughter, hurt and betrayal and a unique way that they go about living life.  These women are so close to my heart that I wish that they were real.  They experience real life ups and downs and they help each other get through them.  The closeness of their friendships is something I can relate too.   I grew up with a half dozen close relationships with my cousins and girlfriends.  
So get ready for a treat.  Pour yourself a cup of coffee, tea or a cold glass of lemonade and sit down and get comfortable as you prepare to go on a journey with them.   Hey you just might discover that its yours.  
From My heart to yours, 
Cordelia" />
