  <title>Cover Up - L.A. Witt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After ten years of blissful marriage, Navy Pilot Nate Chandler is divorcing his cheating husband. Single for the first time in years, Nate is numb to all emotion and kisses any chance of another relationship goodbye.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not only is Nate struggling to get through this divorce, but his body is branded with a permanent reminder of his failed marriage: a matching tattoo with his ex. Searching for a place to cover up his old tattoo, Nate finds himself at the Skin Deep, Inc., where he meets the young and charming cover-up tattoo apprentice, Lucas Brandt. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From just flirty glances to steamy hot encounters, Nate and Lucas dive headfirst into a fling of hookups. But worried that he&#39;ll forever be Nate&#39;s &quot;cover up&quot; rebound relationship, Lucas fears that their love won&#39;t be anything more than just skin deep. What was once just a casual attraction, Lucas now hopes to turn into a real relationship. But will he be able to convince the still tender-hearted Nate to fall in love again?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Third installment of L.A. Witt&#39;s Skin Deep romance series, &lt;i&gt;COVER UP&lt;/i&gt; is a story of passion, pleasure, and happily ever after.&lt;/p&gt;" />
