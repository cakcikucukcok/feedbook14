  <title>Close Contact (Body Armor, Book 3) - Lori Foster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;h2&gt;There&#39;s no resisting a desire like this… &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;MMA fighter Miles Dartman&#39;s casual arrangement with personal shopper Maxi Nevar would be many men&#39;s fantasy. She seeks him out, they have mindblowing sex, she leaves. Rinse, repeat. Yet lately, Miles wants more. And when Maxi requests his services via the Body Armor security agency, he&#39;s ready to finally break through her defenses—and protect her day and night.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Receiving a large inheritance has brought chaos and uncertainty into Maxi&#39;s life. Her ex has resurfaced, along with lots of former &quot;friends,&quot; and someone is making mysterious threats. Then there&#39;s Miles, who doesn&#39;t ask for anything…except her trust. Pleasure is easy. Now Maxi has to give her heart as well as her body…or risk losing a man who could be everything she needs.&lt;/p&gt;
