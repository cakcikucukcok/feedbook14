          &lt;strong&gt;Unlikely partners bound by circumstance…or by fate?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Being rescued by a good-looking bad-boy firefighter isn&#39;t how Samantha Bennett expected to start her stay in Knights Bridge, Massachusetts. Now she has everyone&#39;s attention—especially that of Justin Sloan, her rescuer, who wants to know why she was camped out in an abandoned old New England cider mill.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Samantha is a treasure hunter who has returned to Knights Bridge to solve a three-hundred-year-old mystery and salvage her good name. Justin remembers her well. He&#39;s the one who alerted her late mentor to her iffy past and got her fired. But just because he doesn&#39;t trust her doesn&#39;t mean he can resist her. Samantha is daring, determined, seized by wanderlust—everything that strong, stoic Justin never knew he wanted. Until now…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Carla Neggers’ books have been called “riveting,” &quot;magical&quot; and &quot;stunningly effective.&quot; Now she returns to the lush Swift River Valley with the irresistible story of one woman&#39;s quest for treasure and redemption.&lt;/strong&gt;
