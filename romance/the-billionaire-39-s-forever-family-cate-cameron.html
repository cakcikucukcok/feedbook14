  <title>The Billionaire&#39;s Forever Family - Cate Cameron</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Cassie Frost reaches out to the biological father of the niece she&#39;s raising, she doesn&#39;t expect him to send in the lawyers. Emily is all the family Cassie has left, and she&#39;ll do whatever it takes to keep her niece. But as the owner of a struggling diner going up against a billionaire, the odds aren&#39;t in Cassie&#39;s favor. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When billionaire Will Connelly learns he has a daughter, he&#39;s determined to have a place in her life--even if that means going head-to-head with her proud, stubborn, and irresistible aunt. It&#39;s clear they both want what&#39;s best for Emily, but Will&#39;s not used to being told he&#39;s wrong, and Cassie doesn&#39;t seem to have a problem letting him know whenever she thinks he&#39;s messing up. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will&#39;s sure they can have it all, even if Cassie is determined to stand on her own two feet instead of being swept off them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
