But fantasies didn&#39;t get any more real than Sam Russell. With his competitive intensity urging her on, she took his racing challenge&amp;#151;determined to beat him at his own game. Despite the subzero temperatures, the heat between them was undeniable. Out of control and breathless, the pair hurtled toward the finish line, only to await one last showdown on the snow and ice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
