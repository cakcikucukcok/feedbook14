  <title>Seduction on the Slopes - Tamsen Parker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Snow and Ice Games where competition is not the only thing that is heating up! The second book in bestselling Tamsen Parker&#39;s romance series continues with two competitive teammates. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Miles Palmer has dominated the downhill slalom in every Snow and Ice Games he&#39;s competed in. Double gold, double gold, double gold, and he&#39;s confident he can round out his career and his trophy case with two more medals in his last appearance at the games. The only thing that could stop him? Crash Delaney. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Crash is a young upstart who came out of nowhere and shocked the downhill world with his swagger and untraditional style. As a kid, Crash didn&#39;t have the resources to learn how to race properly, but he begged, borrowed, and stole equipment, and went to any competition he could thumb a ride to. Now the only thing between him and his dreams coming true is his childhood hero, the man whose posters have graced his walls since before he&#39;d ridden in his first chairlift.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Miles and Crash are technically teammates, but you wouldn&#39;t know it from the way they fight. The veteran and the nobody have both got big things riding on this race, and neither can afford any distractions. Especially not each other.&lt;/p&gt;" />
