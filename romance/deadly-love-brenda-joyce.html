  <title>Deadly Love - Brenda Joyce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dear Readers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a confession to make. I never know where my &quot;muse&quot; will take me next. It has been an exciting literary journey--my writing has evolved in many unexpected way, including recently into the realm of powerful and suspenseful contemporary women&#39;s fiction, which I shall continue to write under my own name, Brenda Joyce. I have never lost sight, however, of my audience--my historical romance readers, and especially fans of my books featuring the Bragg family. To this day, many of you still clamor for more Bragg books. Well, imagine my surprise when my &quot;muse&quot; prompted me to begin a new historical romance suspense series--and then I realized a Bragg had to be the hero! And so the nom de plume B.D. Joyce was born, and with it, the first book in an ongoing series,&lt;i&gt; Deadly Love&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the world of Francesca Cahill, crime-solver extraordinaire. Francesca is no ordinary heroine. She refuses to bow to convention, wears her heart on her sleeve, and is determined to right the ills and injustices of society/ Deadly love begins Francesca&#39;s mad escapades when the neighbors&#39; little boy is kidnapped right out of his bed during a society ball. It is January 18, 1902. Francesca stumbles across the ransom note just as she meets New York City&#39;s newly appointed police commissioner, Rick Bragg. And Fracesca can no more stay out of this investigation than she can stop herself from falling love with the city&#39;s determined and powerful police commissioner. But little does she know that on this singular night, he life will change forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let me take you back in time to the lost, magical world of turn-of-the-century New York City--where the glittering mansions of society&#39;s elite are only footsteps away from the impoverished back alleys of the city&#39;sunderbelly--and into the heart of true danger and even truer passion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;br&gt;Best wishes and Happy Reading,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;B.D. Joyce&lt;br&gt;(a.k.a. Brenda Joyce)&lt;/p&gt;" />
