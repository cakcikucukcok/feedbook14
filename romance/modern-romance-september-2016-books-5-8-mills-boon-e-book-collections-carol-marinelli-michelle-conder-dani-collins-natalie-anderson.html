          &lt;strong&gt;The Sheikh&#39;s Baby Scandal by Carol Marinelli&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Playboy sheikh Kedah of Zazinia has loved every minute he&#39;s spent earning his outrageous reputation! But about to claim the throne, and with a list of prospective brides being prepared, Kedah knows he must soon accept his royal duty… A scorching night with his poised assistant Felicia Hamilton seems the perfect distraction-and her cool beauty masks a desire Kedah is hungering to ignite! But even Kedah isn&#39;t prepared for the biggest scandal of all, when their one night together leaves Felicia pregnant with his baby!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Defying the Billionaire&#39;s Command by Michelle Condor &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hardened cynic Dare James is furious. Some woman has gotten her claws into his grandfather. He returns in a blaze of fury to the family estate to lay down the law…only to find himself attracted to the woman he had every intention of evicting. Carly Evans is horrified-she&#39;s his grandfather&#39;s doctor, not a gold-digger! She can&#39;t wait to wipe the smug smile from Dare&#39;s frustratingly handsome face. Only before she knows it, Carly is caught in an inescapable web of attraction…and suddenly defying the billionaire&#39;s command is the last thing she wants to do!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Secret Beneath the Veil by Dani Collins &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With five little words, Mikolas Petrides secures a vital business merger, and finally repays his grandfather for rescuing him from the horrors of his childhood. But, when he lifts his new bride&#39;s veil, it&#39;s not the woman he was expecting! Viveka Brice will do anything to protect her little sister, even pretend to marry a stranger. Her deception revealed, she flees the wedding, but is soon confronted by Mikolas. He is a man who always get what he wants, and if the marriage is off, Viveka will have to compensate him – by becoming his mistress instead!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Mistress That Tamed De Santis by Natalie Crown&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Prince Antonio De Santis hasn&#39;t touched a woman since the tragedy that took his fiancee. But an unexpected encounter with notorious temptress Bella Sanchez, has this royal breaking his one rule…and he discovers this seductress is not what she seems! For Bella, life has been an empty performance since the injury which ended her prima ballerina career. But when Antonio demands her presence in his palace, she can&#39;t resist the stolen moments he offers.&lt;br /&gt;Their forbidden affair must be kept secret, but soon Bella is faced with a choice – surrender her heart, or tame the De Santis prince!&lt;/p&gt;
