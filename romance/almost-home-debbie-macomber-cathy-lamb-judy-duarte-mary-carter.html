But love is the last thing on his mind--he just wants to get the cottage ready for his best friend&#39;s honeymoon. At least that&#39;s the plan, until he finds the gorgeous Maid of Honor ransacking his house--in the most irresistible way.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;The Marrying Kind&quot; by &lt;br&gt;#1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Debbie Macomber&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;High school sweethearts Katie and Jason haven&#39;t seen each other in ten years--and now she&#39;s walked back into his life.  With one look, the love they shared comes flooding back--only now the odds seem stacked against them.  But when something&#39;s meant to be, all bets are off.  .  ." />
