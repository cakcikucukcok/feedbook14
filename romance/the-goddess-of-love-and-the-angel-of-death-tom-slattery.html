  <title>The Goddess of Love and the Angel of Death - Tom Slattery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;The Goddess of Love and the Angel of Death&lt;/i&gt; revolves around a nude female nightclub stripper, Selina, and a nude male art model, Owen. Conceived of as a modernized &quot;Adam and Eve,&quot; gender-reversing Owen tempts Selina with a piece of plastic sculpture.&lt;p&gt;
A generation later, their daughter, Lisa, who had been adopted as a baby, learns of them from a psychology professor who had met them while researching pornography in which they peripherally participated. As the story unfolds, Lisa learns that her biological parents were also talented artists.&lt;p&gt;
The story itself is a love story of a young black woman, Selina, and an older white man, Owen. If their art and love may be the &quot;good&quot; of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, neo-Nazi racism and drug gang-banging may be the &quot;evil.&quot; The underlying theme is a triumph of art and life over pornography. The story&#39;s complex ending may bring sorrow and meaning while gladdening the heart." />
