  <title>Have Baby, Need Billionaire &amp; The Sarantos Secret Baby - Maureen Child, Olivia Gates</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;strong&gt;Two fan-favorite stories of powerful men&amp;#133;wrapped around their babies&#39; little fingers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have Baby, Need Billionaire by Maureen Child&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Simon Bradley has certainly never met&amp;#151;or gone to bed with&amp;#151;Tula Barrons. He&#39;d remember that. Still he lets Tula and her infant cousin&amp;#151;a child she claims is his&amp;#151;stay in his mansion until he has proof of paternity. Having Tula near reveals something that gives him the perfect opportunity for revenge&amp;#133;but does he risk it?&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Sarantos Secret Baby by Olivia Gates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aris Sarantos is her family&#39;s hated adversary. But that doesn&#39;t stop Selene Louvardis from wanting him. Or taking one forbidden night with him. When he later storms back into her life and discovers she&#39;s had his child, nothing stops the ruthless billionaire from claiming his own. Not her family, not the business and certainly not something as inconvenient as love." />
