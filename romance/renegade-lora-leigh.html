  <title>Renegade - Lora Leigh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As a bridal shop owner, Mikayla Martin helps make women&#39;s wedding dreams come true. Her own life, however, has become a nightmare since she witnessed a murder--and got an up-close-and-personal look at the killer. What&#39;s worse: She &lt;i&gt;knows &lt;/i&gt;she knows him. But the police, after doing an alibi check, don&#39;t believe her. It&#39;s up to Mikayla to prove them wrong...and do whatever it takes to solve the murder by herself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elite Ops agent Nikolai Steele, code name Renegade, is asked to pay an old comrade a favor. This friend swears he&#39;s no killer--and Nik believes him--even though he&#39;s been mistaken as one by Mikayla. So Nik goes to set her straight...but the moment he lays eyes on the fiery and determined beauty, he knows he&#39;s in too deep. A woman this irresistible can only mean trouble and, sure enough, after sticking her nose in one too many places, someone wants Mikayla dead. Now Nik must find a way to keep her safe, clear his friend&#39;s name, &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;find the real killer, who remains on the loose...&lt;/p&gt;" />
