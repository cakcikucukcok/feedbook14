  <title>A Marriage Under the Terror - Patricia Wentworth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;A Marriage Under the Terror&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;was awarded in England the first prize in the Melrose Novel Competition, a competition that was not restricted to first stories. The distinguished literary reputation of the three judges - Mrs. Flora Annie Steel, Miss Mary Cholmondeley, and Mrs. Henry de la Pasture - was a guaranty alike to the contestants and to the public that the story selected as the winner would without question be fully entitled to that distinction. In consequence, many authors of experience entered the contest, with the result that the number of manuscripts submitted was greater than that in the competition previously conducted by Mr. Melrose.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Among such a number of good stories, individual taste must always play an important part in the decision. It is, therefore, no small tribute to the transcendent interest of the winning novel that, though the judges worked independently, each selected &lt;i&gt;A Marriage Under the Terror&lt;/i&gt; as the most distinctive novel in the group." />
