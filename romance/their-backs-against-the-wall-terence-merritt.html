  <title>Their Backs Against the Wall - Terence Merritt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jerry is a well-educated man. Not only does he have a college degree, but hes street-smart, having grown up selling drugs on the streets of Savannah, Georgia. He enlists in the army, but upon his return to civilian life, he goes back to his old, dangerous ways. After receiving his MBA, though, he finally realizes its time to move on; he heads to far-off Chicago, Illinois, looking for a new, clean start.
He meets Karena beautiful woman who seemingly comes from a different world. She is highly educated, and her family fought brave battles in the Civil Rights movement. Jerry cant help himself; he falls head-over-heels in love. Karen shows him a way to live a life of love, but she also shows him how to love &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt;in the bedroom and out.
Its never easy to escape the past, though, as Jerry soon discovers. Along with his newfound feelings for Karen, the skeletons in his closet come knocking. Can two people from different places and different backgrounds survive the sins of the past? In order to defeat dangerous obstacles, Jerry and Karen will have to lean on their passion for one anotheror else fall into old habits and lost love." />
