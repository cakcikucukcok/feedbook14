  <title>The Wyoming Cowboy (Mills &amp; Boon American Romance) (Daddy Dude Ranch, Book 1) - Rebecca Winters</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;A Cowboy Who Cares&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ex-Marine Carson Lundgren&#39;s Wyoming ranch is a place where families of fallen war heroes can find joy and healing. The wounded vet is eager to give back, while rebuilding his own life. The last thing he expected is to fall for his first guest and her young son. Widow Tracy Baretta and six-year-old Johnny have been struggling since losing their husband and father.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When they meet Carson, his strength, patience and generosity – along with how great he looks on a horse – leads little Johnny to call him “king of the cowboys”. They’ve fallen in love with the place…and maybe with the man himself. But is she just looking for a surrogate father? Or could this incredible cowboy really be the one who’ll make her and her son believe in love again?&lt;/p&gt;
