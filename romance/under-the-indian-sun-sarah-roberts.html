  <title>Under the Indian Sun - Sarah Roberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Annie, a woman who loves to travel, decides to take her dream vacation to India, all she intends to do is have some exclusive time for herself. Little does she know that she is to lose her heart and soul to the handsome, dark-haired young man from Delhi, India, with whom she has developed a friendship while preparing for her trip. When they finally meet upon her arrival to India, sparks fly and set off a fire of emotions, passion, and love between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After her tour is over, they spend some idyllic time together, visiting ancient places of the famous city, where Ashok takes Annie through a whirlpool of exotic experiences and emotions as he acts as her guide. Annie is sure that she has met her soul mate in Ashok, and he is sure that Annie has given him the joy, love, and passion no one has given him before. But once back in the United States, she is not so sure. Ashok seems distant, and suddenly their differences in culture, religion, and age rear their ugly heads, and Annie begins to wonder. Can their love sustain itself through the obstacles they have to face, or are both of them heading for heartbreak?&lt;/p&gt;" />
