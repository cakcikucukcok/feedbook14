  <title>Temptation by Fire - Tiffany Allee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In Temptation by Fire by Tiffany Allee,  Ava has a vision of a man&#39;s violent death, and experience tells her she can&#39;t stop it from happening. For once, she&#39;s wrong. She saves him, but in doing so enters a world of manipulative demons and the men who hunt them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Driven by the memory of his murdered family, Karson toils in the violent, thankless fight against demonkind. Masquerading as humans, demons are always a step ahead. But just when he thinks vengeance will be his, Ava shatters his plans and twists his focus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her powers have pushed her away from human contact, but this tattooed hunter with a battered heart draws Ava in. Working with the pretty little psychic is a challenge Karson can handle. But keeping his hands off of her is nearly impossible. With demons on their trail and Ava determined to make things right, keeping his heart safe will be just as tough as keeping Ava alive.&lt;/p&gt;" />
