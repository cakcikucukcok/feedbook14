  <title>Dream Keeper - Amber R. Duell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Sandman is seventeen-year-old Nora&amp;rsquo;s closest friend and best-kept secret. He has to be, if she doesn&amp;rsquo;t want a one-way ticket back to the psychiatrist. It took her too long to learn not to mention the hooded figure in her dreams to her mother, who still watches Nora as if she&amp;rsquo;ll crack. So when Nora&amp;rsquo;s friends start mysteriously dying gruesome deaths in their sleep, she isn&amp;rsquo;t altogether surprised when the police direct their suspicion at her. The Sandman is the only one she can turn to for answers. But the truth might be more than she bargained for&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For the last five years, the Sandman has spent every night protecting Nora. When he hid the secret to the Nightmare Lord&amp;rsquo;s escape inside her dreams, he never expected to fall in love with her. Neither did he think his nemesis would find her so quickly, but there&amp;rsquo;s no mistaking his cruel handiwork. The Nightmare Lord is tired of playing by the rules and will do anything to release his deadly nightmares into the world, even if that means tormenting Nora until she breaks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When the Nightmare Lord kidnaps Nora&amp;rsquo;s sister, Nora must enter enemy territory to save her. The Sandman is determined to help, but if Nora isn&amp;rsquo;t careful, she could lose even more than her family to the darkness." />
