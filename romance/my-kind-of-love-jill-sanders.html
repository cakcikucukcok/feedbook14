  <title>My Kind of Love - Jill Sanders</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Carrie was broken-hearted when Joshua, left town after a messy breakup. Two years have passed, and she&amp;rsquo;s done waiting around for him. Finally moving on, she has her eyes on a new-comer to Pride, but just when things are starting to heat up, Josh strolls back into town. No longer a boy, but the man of all her fantasies. She knows she must play it cool or risk losing her heart again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Josh left Pride to try and find himself, but after two years of searching the world and himself, he returned back home a little wiser and with a new mission. Seeing Carrie again had been a shock to his system but watching her hang on the arm of another man had been an even bigger shock. Now his only goal in life was earning the trust of the woman he&amp;rsquo;d always loved and trying to win her back, at any costs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
