  <title>Touch of Passion - Susan Spencer Paul</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;My Dearest Reader,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;When you hear my story, perhaps you will think me a man unable to control his own hungers...his own temptations. But I warn you that I am no such thing. I am simply a man who knows what he wants, and what he can&#39;t live without.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is only fair to tell you that my clan is one descended from magic. I have learned these powers are both a blessing and a curse--for the magic that flows through my blood controls my fate utterly and completely.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;When I first saw the beautiful Loris, I knew she was my unoliaeth, my oneness, the woman I am destined to unite with for all eternity. At that moment, I allowed my passion to lead me to do the unthinkable: I employed a forbidden magic to win Loris&#39;s heart. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;How did I know that my error would lead to a black curse that still haunts me today? How could I have known that the curse would irrevocably cast Loris&#39; affection for me to another man?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Now I am left to ponder how I might win Loris back--black curse be damned. I believe there must be a way. For while it is the darkest realms of magic that keeps Loris from becoming mine, there is another power at play: the undying, unending love of one man for one woman. And I pray that in the end, that will be enough...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Your obedient servant,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kian &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Seymour&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;, Castle Tylluan, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;London&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
