      <meta name="description" content="Ursula and Gudrun Brangwen sat one morning in the window-bay of their father&amp;#39;s house in Beldover, working and talking. Ursula was stitching a piece of brightly-coloured embroidery, and Gudrun was drawing upon a board which she held on her knee. They were mostly silent, talking as their thoughts strayed through their minds.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#39;Ursula,&amp;#39; said Gudrun, &amp;#39;don&amp;#39;t you REALLY WANT to get married?&amp;#39; Ursula laid her embroidery in her lap and looked up. Her face was calm and considerate.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#39;I don&amp;#39;t know,&amp;#39; she replied. &amp;#39;It depends how you mean.&amp;#39;&lt;br /&gt;
Gudrun was slightly taken aback. She watched her sister for some moments.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#39;Well,&amp;#39; she said, ironically, &amp;#39;it usually means one thing! But don&amp;#39;t you think anyhow, you&amp;#39;d be&amp;mdash;&amp;#39; she darkened slightly&amp;mdash;&amp;#39;in a better position than you are in now.&amp;#39;&lt;br /&gt;
A shadow came over Ursula&amp;#39;s face.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#39;I might,&amp;#39; she said. &amp;#39;But I&amp;#39;m not sure.&amp;#39;&lt;br /&gt;
Again Gudrun paused, slightly irritated. She wanted to be quite definite.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#39;You don&amp;#39;t think one needs the EXPERIENCE of having been married?&amp;#39; she asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#39;Do you think it need BE an experience?&amp;#39; replied Ursula.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#39;Bound to be, in some way or other,&amp;#39; said Gudrun, coolly. &amp;#39;Possibly undesirable, but bound to be an experience of some sort.&amp;#39;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#39;Not really,&amp;#39; said Ursula. &amp;#39;More likely to be the end of experience.&amp;#39;&lt;br /&gt;
Gudrun sat very still, to attend to this..." />
