      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;100 Shades of Sin...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dane captivated Ari from the first moment their eyes locked. Every second thereafter proved they were either fated for love...or devastation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It was a little scary how my body trembled and my breathing wouldn&#39;t return to normal. But I couldn&#39;t escape the intensity of our desire for each other--and how vibrant and alive he made me feel. Like I&#39;d merely existed before. Gotten by. Now I was acutely aware of my surroundings. Of myself. Of him. Of every sensation blazing inside me...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ari DeMille has spent her life focusing on the details and planning down to the minute. Haunted by her parents&#39; ugly divorce, Ari believes the only way to prevent emotional scars is to always maintain control. But when the devastatingly handsome-and powerfully dominant-Dane Bax, her new boss, pushes Ari&#39;s boundaries, she must learn to shatter the ties that bind her if she is to sate her newfound desires... But giving into insatiable lust comes with a price. Dane&#39;s luxury hotel business is threatened by a consortium of dangerous men who threaten everything Ari holds close. And as the stakes are raised, Ari is treacherously close to losing all control of her life...and her heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get lost in the passion of &lt;i&gt;Burned Deep&lt;/i&gt; by Calista Fox&lt;/p&gt;" />
