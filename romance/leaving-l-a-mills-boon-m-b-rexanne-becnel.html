  <title>Leaving L.a. (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Rexanne Becnel</title>

        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;There&#39;s a first time for everything&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;…as thirty-nine-year-old Zoe Vidrine learned the hard way. She was pregnant! Now the aging rock &#39;n&#39; roller had to change her tune fast. Her plan: leave behind the temptations of L.A.–and her famous hard-partying ex who had got her into this mess–and return to her family&#39;s Louisiana homestead to regroup.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It had been twenty years, and the Day Glo hippie haven where Zoe had spent an unhappy childhood was gone, remodeled in the signature pastels of her prim sister Alice. Alice&#39;s aesthetic sense was hard enough to swallow, but her holier-than-thou attitude set the stage for a showdown. Still, as the sisters gradually came to terms with their shared past, would there be a meeting of the minds? Talk about firsts…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;USA TODAY&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Rexanne Becnel has created all twenty-two of her novels in coffeehouses, writing longhand. Thanks to the stimulating effects of way too many cups of coffee, she&#39;s found a grateful audience of both readers and critics.&lt;/p&gt;
