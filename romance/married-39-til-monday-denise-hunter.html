  <title>Married &#39;til Monday - Denise Hunter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With a big anniversary party in the works for his ex-wife&amp;rsquo;s parents, Ryan has just one weekend to play Abby&amp;rsquo;s husband&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. and win back the woman of his dreams.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ryan McKinley has tried to move on from his ex-wife, Abby. He&amp;rsquo;s sulked, he&amp;rsquo;s gotten angry, and ultimately he bought her dream house. Big mistake. Living alone in the massive two-story has only made him miss her more. When her parents call him out of the blue about their anniversary party in Summer Harbor, Maine, Ryan believes God has dropped a golden opportunity straight in his lap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abby McKinley never exactly told her parents about the divorce. A strained relationship with her dad has culminated in a distant relationship with her parents, but she&amp;rsquo;s finally succumbed to her mom&amp;rsquo;s pressure to make the drive for their 35th-anniversary party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Ryan shows up on her doorstep, looking as handsome as ever. When he insists he&amp;rsquo;s going to Summer Harbor, with or without her, Abby knows she can&amp;rsquo;t say no. Her parents still think they&amp;rsquo;re married and now Ryan knows it too. It&amp;rsquo;s just a one-week road trip with the man who broke her heart. What could possibly go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;" />
