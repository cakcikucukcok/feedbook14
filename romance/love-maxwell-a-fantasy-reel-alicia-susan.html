  <title>Love &amp; Maxwell—A Fantasy Reel - Alicia Susan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Opposites attract and repel, but can opposites gel forever? Love Moonjay is an expert in business and knows her stuff. Her love life, on the other hand, is nonexistent. Maxwell, a popular singer and songwriter, is highly thought of by his screaming, panting, mostly female fans. He may be constantly publicly linked to beautiful women, but he guards his personal life as well as, if not better than, Fort Knox.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Love needs to shake things up, and step outside her comfort zone, if she is going to change her boring way of life. A girls retreat to New Orleans and her first secular concert is a step in the right direction. Love is excited about the adventures that await her until she sets eyes on Maxwell.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Max, while uncomfortable with the attention his fame brings, is accustomed to certain responses from the opposite sex. His reaction to seeing Love in the audience in New Orleans puts him in unfamiliar territory. Max cant help himself, he singles her out. Once Max grips Loves hand no one else exist in the crowd arena. Max wants Love; therefore, she must desire him.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Love finds himself falling under the sensual spell of Max. What Max knows for sure is that Love will be in his bed tonight. Love knows seduction and its Maxz hypnotic eyes, intoxicating kisses, powerful hands and magical fingers.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Love and Max both regret the night before but for different reasons.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Fate and desire bring Love and Maxwell together. They want each other desperately but fear and secrets threaten to tear them apart.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Love wants marriage and children. Most importantly she wants real love. Does Max desire the same things? Or is he a smooth lothario and is Love his latest conquest? Time will reveal all truths, especially in love.&lt;/P&gt;" />
