  <title>The Ghost Between Us - Pete Nunweiler, Laura M Wilkinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Tobias (Toby) and Annaliese (Anna) Miller were a perfect couple. Romantic, passionate and truly best friends. When he loses her after a car accident, he takes a leave of absence from work to carry out his promise to Anna and moves to the &amp;ldquo;Forever House&amp;rdquo; in the mountains of Tennessee. It&amp;rsquo;s their dream come true carried out by one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after he settles in, he hears strange noises in the house but brushes them off until his realtor, Alexandra (Alex), shares a dark secret with him and he learns of her heartbreaking connection to the house. Over time, Toby and Alex become closer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a paranormal enthusiast, Toby no longer dismisses the strange noises and tries to connect with the entity in the house. His research begins with simple closed-ended questions and progresses to full conversations through EVPs and a Spirit Box. Toby&amp;rsquo;s increasing obsession with the paranormal builds an obsession with the ghost, sparking a forbidden love triangle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will the entity keep Toby and Alex apart?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ghost Between Us is where paranormal romance meets suspense thriller. It will grab you from the very first page and won&amp;rsquo;t let go until the last.&lt;/p&gt;" />
