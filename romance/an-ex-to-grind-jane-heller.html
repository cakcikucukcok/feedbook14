  <title>An Ex to Grind - Jane Heller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;p&gt;The battle of the sexes rages on in this smart, witty, and extremely timely comedy from the phenomenally popular Jane Heller&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, Manhattan financial planner Melanie Banks adores Dan Swain, her pro football player husband who&#39;s got a sexy Oklahoma drawl to go with his athletic good looks. But then his career comes to a screeching halt and he spends the next few years out of a job, seemingly unconcerned about it. Suddenly, she&#39;s the one bringing home the bacon and falling out of love with the paycheck-devouring, couch-sitting mooch. Divorce is the answer, she decides -- only to learn she has to fork over alimony while he lives like a prince on her income &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; she has to share custody of their precious dog, Buster. Consumed with the unfairness of it all, she plays dirty, hiring a high-profile matchmaker to find some unsuspecting female she can dump on Dan for ninety days and cause him to violate their cohabitation clause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then Melanie&#39;s scheme backfires. Her ex&#39;s new love revitalizes him, miraculously transforming him into the focused, responsible go-getter she always hoped he&#39;d be. And now, with the ninety-day clock about to chime, she realizes she wants him back.&lt;/p&gt;" />
