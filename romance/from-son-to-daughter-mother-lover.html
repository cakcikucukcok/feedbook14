  <title>From Son to Daughter - Mother Lover</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Piper has been having difficulty with her son cleaning up after himself. She decided to confront him one day, walking into his empty room. When she walked in, he was nowhere to be seen, and when she was just going to wait for him, she noticed his stash of porn. After a range of motions, she finally decided to settle on one, giddiness. She decided to take advantage of this, and make her son her personal sissy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
He started opening his mouth, about to yell or scream, or even plead about something, but she just raised one finger, and his mouth snapped shut. She gestured to the couch, and ordered, &amp;ldquo;Sit down.&amp;rdquo; He complied, not putting up any kind of fight, already resigned to his natural role. When he sat down, he looked down at his hands in his lap, not able to look up. &amp;ldquo;Sweetie,&amp;rdquo; She murmured, honeying her words, &amp;ldquo;Please, look up at me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With all of the effort in his body, he looked up at her, a tear starting to form in his eye. She leaned over and wiped it away, a placating smile on her lips. &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, I&amp;rsquo;m not mad,&amp;rdquo; She murmured, trying to reassure her son. With that, a hopeful look appeared in his eyes, hope that he wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to be judged, or thrown out like he was afraid. She held his face, hand on cheek, wiping away any stray tear on his face. She leaned in and whispered, &amp;ldquo;Trust me, I&amp;rsquo;m not mad, sure I was shocked at first, concerned also, but not mad. I even went through your browser history as well.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
