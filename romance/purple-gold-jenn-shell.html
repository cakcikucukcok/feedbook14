  <title>Purple Gold - Jenn Shell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; Forty-four-year-old Rebecca Harden Miles imaginary past, created long ago in her best interest, is catching up with her. There was never a need to reveal the truth about herselfuntil now. As her daughter, Emily, prepares to get married, Rebecca is convinced she must confess, but doing so could cost her the love of her husband, Lance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebeccas masquerade, a lifetime of lies that soothed her as she came to believe in them, could now expose her daughter to a life of heartache and possible catastrophe. The answer lies in the sudden and unexplained deaths of Rebecca and Lances twin boys, David and Dennis, before they turned one, decades ago. Now, she must travel back before she can move ahead. Her gamble to discover the truth takes her on an unexpected journey with unexpected revelations.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this compelling family saga, Rebecca seeks to protect her daughterbut in her quest for answers, she learns much more than what the time-worn medical records could have revealed. &lt;/p&gt;" />
