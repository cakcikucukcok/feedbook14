Calliopes Diary offers a personal journal
full of ideas and questions
designed to lead you to
philosophize, organize, energize and ponder
Calliopes Diary also tells the tales of the lives, labors and loves or interesting, modern women.
Read their stories.
Read their diaries
and then
add to this new and different type of journal. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Its flirtation infidelity! Calliope declares after discovering that Mr. Amorous-Guy-at-Work has a girlfriend.  Calli, as Calliope is informally called, shares her angst with her friend Clary as they alternately chit-chat and process their thoughts in their diaries.  Calli is happily distracted by Clarys journal that organizes all aspects of her busy life.
In Calliopes Diary, Calli connects with her seven closest friends who express their ideas and process their emotions with the help of their journals.  Their other-than-blank journal pages:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
1)Organize our thoughts and goals--in business ledger-inspired pages&lt;br&gt;
2)Offer an opportunity to vent frustrationson pages with questions designed to pull forth the readers&#39; feelings&lt;br&gt;
3)Lead readers to discover what they are made ofby diagramming where they have been through the use of time lines and historical contexts&lt;br&gt;
4)Assist journalers in further defining who they arethrough the use of lists of the readers&#39; favorite things&lt;br&gt;
5)Encourage us to be gratefulwith the help of calendar pages inviting reflections on thanks and manifesting&lt;br&gt;
6)Focus our powerby using a series of tools both to define challenges and overcome&lt;br&gt; 7)Help us determine life directionon divided pages that welcome both the ideas of the journal owner as well as the musings of a fellow diarist&lt;br&gt;
8)Provide a place to reflect upon our beliefs--in a manifesto-type section that asks the reader to define her beliefs." />
