  <title>Windfallen - Jojo Moyes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the #1 &lt;/em&gt;New York Times&lt;em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;/em&gt;Me Before You&lt;em&gt;, the basis for the major motion picture, comes a breathtaking drama of two women whose lives entwine through a lovely English seaside house.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Lottie Swift, Arcadia has always been magical. The breathtaking art deco house perched above the shoreline of the well-ordered village of Merham seems to stand still throughout the years. It has never changed, not really, but Lottie&#39;s fate and fortune have been inextricably linked with that of the beautiful house, and it will forever be fixed in her mind as a symbol of adventure, youth, and of loves lost and gained. Even as her life&amp;#8212;and the house&amp;#8212;fall into disrepair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years later another young woman comes to Merham. A designer hired to make over the now-empty Arcadia, Daisy Parsons seeks a new beginning, as Lottie once did. Fleeing a broken relationship and now facing being a single mother, Daisy finds refuge in the house, and something more&amp;#8212;a love she thought she would never know again and a friendship unlike any she&amp;#8217;s experienced before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
