  <title>For His Pleasure - Suzanne Rock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A sensual tale about the risks and rewards of falling in too deep-&lt;i&gt;and loving it&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;PASSION COMES WITH A PRICE.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Tired of living a lie, Arianna Perconti leaves her fiancé at the altar and runs into the arms of her family&#39;s fiercest rival, Jason Stone. Hoping to cash in on their &#39;friends-with-benefits&#39; arrangement while hiding out from bitter relatives, Ari instead finds herself falling deeply, desperately in love with the sexy hotelier. Jason is everything she never knew she wanted-yet she will do absolutely everything to show him she means business. In bed...  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CAN THEY AFFORD TO LIVE WITHOUT IT?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Jason lives in the fast lane and has the race cars to prove it. A born adrenaline junkie, he must admit that Ari is the perfect partner for his heart-pumping bedroom games. The problem? The relationship is starting to deepen, but is Jason really cut out to be a one-woman kind of man?  The question haunts his days, only fueling the passion he and Ari share during those hot, hot nights. But when an estranged sibling enters the picture, threatening to take away everything he holds dear, Jason is forced to make a decision: Say goodbye to his wild ways or risk losing Ari forever?&lt;/p&gt;" />
