      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Educating the Cowboy&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Raising his orphaned teenage sister isn&#39;t easy for Texas rancher Cash Maddox. The girl tests his parenting–and patience–at every turn! But when he asks new teacher Olivia Grayson for help with his sister&#39;s grades and attitude, Cash realizes he&#39;s facing the toughest trial of all. He made a promise that he wouldn&#39;t date and get distracted from his mission of being a good father figure. Yet Olivia&#39;s quick wit is drawing him unexpectedly closer to the caring beauty every day. Could it be time to make a new vow…one that&#39;ll last a lifetime?&lt;/p&gt;
