  <title>Betting on Love - Jennifer Hoopes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Whitney Carroll is back home in Gatlinburg, Tennessee after divorcing her low-down, cheating husband. First thing on the to-do list: Get a job. Second thing: Just say no to men. Third thing: Don&#39;t fall for the boss. One out of three&#39;s not too bad, right? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Sam Ellis, his to-do list is always work, work, work, trying to keep his family&#39;s legacy alive. Now, out of concern, his siblings bet he can&#39;t keep a girl happy for thirty days, and if he loses he&#39;s out as CEO. No problem, he can fake a relationship. And he knows just who to ask...his new man-vegan assistant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet Whitney&#39;s sexy boss--secret singer and Skee-Ball champion--is definitely NOT boring, and their connection is undeniable. But when a disaster strikes at work, Sam will have to decide if he&#39;s willing to trade in his job for his heart.&lt;/p&gt;" />
