  <title>Alpha Billionaire - J.l. Ryan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Don&amp;#39;t miss this 4-book steamy billionaire romance boxed set!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Billionaire&amp;#39;s Gift&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Frantic and broke, April Edwards is blindsided when she&amp;#39;s wrongfully fired from her job at an exclusive resort after a customer inappropriately touches her. Believing it was her fault, her boss won&amp;#39;t even consider giving her back her job or even hearing her side of the story.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Witnessing the entire scene, mysterious billionaire Nigel Conroy offers her a life of luxury so that she&amp;#39;ll never have to work again. Does he really want to help her, or is he hiding a heart-pounding secret that could jeopardize her well-being?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Billionaire Boss&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Down on her luck, Rachel Greene finally lands her dream job. It&amp;#39;s absolutely perfect, except for one thing... her boss.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sexy billionaire bad boy Byron Blakemore is filthy rich, arrogant, and sexy as hell. He always gets his way, and nobody ever says &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; to him. He&amp;#39;s a certified workaholic, who uses women as a means of escaping corporate life.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When he lays his slick moves on curvy girl Rachel, he&amp;#39;s shocked when she rejects him. No one has ever turned him down. What is it about her that he&amp;#39;s obsessed with? Could he be falling in love, or is he planning his revenge on her when she uncovers his sordid past?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;This Boxed Set Also Includes:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;The Billionaire&amp;#39;s Caregiver&lt;br /&gt;
