  <title>Hardly Working (Mills &amp; Boon Silhouette) - Betsy Burke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Dinah Nichols, PR chick for Green World International, knows how to spin a story. She has to, otherwise how else would rescuing loons get the media attention it deserves? But a visit from Higher Management guru Ian Trutch means she&#39;ll have to put some spin on the &quot;fabulous work&quot; she and the staff have been doing.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sure, her latest hobby of haranguing a cocky colleague is worthwhile, but it isn&#39;t part of GWI&#39;s mission statement or anything. So, how to convince the higher-ups she and the others are working hard for their higher purpose? Hmm. Dating Trutch seemed the obvious move, but now she&#39;s not so sure he is what he says he is, and the office is turned upside down as acts of local ecoterrorism are suddenly on the rise, and Dinah&#39;s famed mother–a bona fide well-known Jacques Cousteau type–makes an unforgettable appearance, putting Dinah&#39;s entire career in jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Will Dinah navigate her eclectic crew to safety, or will they have to swim for it?&lt;/p&gt;
