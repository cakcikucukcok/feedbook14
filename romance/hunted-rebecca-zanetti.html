But the more she learns about Connlan Kayrs, the more she comes to think this is normal behavior for him.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;There&#39;s Nowhere To Hide&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Conn and Moira tumbled on the moonlit grass, Conn hadn&#39;t meant to mark her as his mate for all time. She was only twenty! But it wasn&#39;t easy to wait for her. It was even harder to forget her. So when he finally returns for his wicked-hot witch, he&#39;s ready to let the sparks flying.
