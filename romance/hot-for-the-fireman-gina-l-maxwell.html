  <title>Hot for the Fireman - Gina L. Maxwell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ex-Army Ranger Erik Grady lives for the job. So when his chief at the Boston Fire Department offers him two choices--mandated therapy for supposed PTSD or a permanent desk job at the station, he reluctantly agrees to see a shrink. Only this doctor is unlike anything he expected. Female and curved in all the right places? Check. Hotter than a four-alarm fire? Check. The kind of woman that can heat his blood in and out of bed? Check, check. And oh, yeah, he just happens to have first hand experience... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of all the men to walk into psychologist Olivia Jones&#39; office, why did it have to be him? Her one-night stand isn&#39;t playing by the rules of just. One. Night. She&#39;s had her heart broken in the past, and no way is she going there again. And now he&#39;s blackmailing her into three dates? Well, if that&#39;s what it takes to make him see a different therapist, fine. She can handle it. So what if the chemistry between them is combustible? She&#39;s a professional, damn it. She&#39;ll date Mr. I&#39;m Too Sexy For My Bunker Pants. But it won&#39;t end in the fun he expects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s time to see how much heat this fireman can take...&lt;/p&gt;" />
