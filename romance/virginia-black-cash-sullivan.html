  <title>Virginia Black - Cash Sullivan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Kari Brown knew how to do one thing in&lt;BR&gt;
life  survive. She was an excellent mother&lt;BR&gt;
and a faithful wife to her husband. Many&lt;BR&gt;
women coveted Michael Brown, Karis&lt;BR&gt;
high school sweetheart, a former war-hero&lt;BR&gt;
and a dedicated Blacksburg police offi cer.&lt;BR&gt;
He used and abused that knowledge to his&lt;BR&gt;
advantage. Though outward appearances&lt;BR&gt;
epitomized a wholesome family, living the&lt;BR&gt;
American dream, behind closed doors, the&lt;BR&gt;
dream had become a nightmare. Hopelessly,&lt;BR&gt;
Kari learned to withstand the mental and&lt;BR&gt;
physical abuse of a man who left for Iraq as a&lt;BR&gt;
young and loving husband and returned as a&lt;BR&gt;
stranger full of rage and unpredictability. In&lt;BR&gt;
a surprising twist of fate, Kari finds herself&lt;BR&gt;
at a crossroads she never expected to be at,&lt;BR&gt;
befriending Winston, a dedicated college&lt;BR&gt;
student who offers her the strength to walk&lt;BR&gt;
away and a love she forgot she needed.&lt;BR&gt;
Winstons devoted protection gives Kari&lt;BR&gt;
sanctuary and leads her to Ireland. Once&lt;BR&gt;
there, she learns she has a new family, ready&lt;BR&gt;
to help fashion a better life for Kari and her&lt;BR&gt;
children. Follow along as Kari makes the&lt;BR&gt;
journey from the dark prison she has been&lt;BR&gt;
captive to, into the light of a new, more&lt;BR&gt;
hopeful future.&lt;BR&gt;" />
