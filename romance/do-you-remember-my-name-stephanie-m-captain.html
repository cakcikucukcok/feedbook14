    Do You Remember My Name?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    If you have ever had to fight your way through life. If it has ever seemed there was no relief in sight and the battle was never ending. If it has ever
    appeared everything was out of control and your dreams and promises were nowhere to be found. If you have ever felt abandoned, forgotten or forsaken; while
    doing the right thing. If you have ever had to put an all points bulletin out for peace; do a missing persons report for joy. If you have ever felt like
    God was distant. If you have ever felt like God was silent; then this book is for you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    It is time to Remember
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The Plan
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    It was a well thought out plan
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    He considered me
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    He weighed the consequences
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    He purposely orchestrated a plan
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    That would bring me to the point of destiny and purpose
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Then he placed me in it
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    He considered every high and low
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    He planned every detail
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Then he sent me to my appointment to live out my purpose
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    He then sat down with all confidence
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Satisfied, knowing I would make it
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Ps. 138:8
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The Lord will fulfill [his purpose] for me;
