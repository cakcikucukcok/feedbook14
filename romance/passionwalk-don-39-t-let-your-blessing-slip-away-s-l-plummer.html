  <title>Passionwalk: Don&#39;t Let Your Blessing Slip Away - S. L. Plummer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Insatiable but inexperienced, Saundra is at a crossroads. Devastated by her last relationship, she&#39;s torn by the impulses of her own body. A voluptuous, bisexual, black Christian beauty, she has quit praying for her soul mate to find her. Like Saundra, Nehemiah&#39;s battered heart, betrayed by his ex-wife, has abandoned hope that the woman his great-aunt prophesied will find him. If he can trust God to deliver her, can she be the dream he had left in his childhood? Their first date is one of discovery. Despite their Christian vows, they share a strong sexual appetite. &quot;Forgive us, God,&quot; they pray as foreplay gets heated. Eventually forsaking celibacy, they learn to trust the connection that leads to a passionate journey. Together, they face cultural tensions that break open moral contradictions in their sexual playground. Nehemiah admits to his past infidelity but is shaken by Saundra&#39;s silence about her own history. Can they trust each other, or will history repeat itself?" />
