        &lt;h2&gt;Four Sizzlingly Sexy Romance from Mills &amp; Boon!&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Spaniard&#39;s Untouched Bride&lt;/em&gt; by Maisey Yates&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Camilla Alvarez refuses to abandon her beloved horses when formidable tycoon Matias Navarro acquires her family’s renowned rancho. Instead, she disguises herself as his stable-boy! Yet when Camilla’s charade is discovered, Matias offers her an even more shocking role—as his wife! Innocent Camilla is transformed into a bride deserving of his diamonds, but their convenient marriage is transformed by the scalding heat of their wedding night…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Secret Kept from the Italian&lt;/em&gt; by Kate Hewitt&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Looking up from the table she’s serving, waitress Maisie Dobson is horrified to meet the intense gaze of Antonio Rossi, merciless billionaire and father of her child! Rejected after one mind-blowing night, Maisie kept her unexpected pregnancy a secret. Antonio’s determined to claim his daughter, but their connection reminds Maisie that she still has to protect her heart – because billionaires don’t wed waitresses…do they?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Claimed for the Billionaire&#39;s Convenience&lt;/em&gt; by Melanie Milburne&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When headlines mistakenly announce florist Holly Frost’s engagement to ruthless celebrity divorce lawyer Zack Knight, she’s stunned. His lethal charisma may have ignited a fire in her blood, but she’s finished with fairytales. Yet Zack seems determined to turn this scandal, and their red-hot attraction, to their mutual advantage… Swept away to Paris, Holly must remember this alliance is only temporary – even while wearing his diamond!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Bought Virgin Wife&lt;/em&gt; by Caitlin Crews&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I’ve never wanted anything like I want heiress Imogen Fitzalan. I married her to secure my empire— but my untouched wife has ignited an undeniable hunger in me. Desire beyond reason wasn’t my plan, yet now I have a new aim: to strip away her obedience, and replace it with a fierce passion to match my own…&lt;/p&gt;
