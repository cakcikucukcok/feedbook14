  <title>Love Triumphs All - Cherrill Clough</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Evan Andrews, twenty-six, is a real Adonis as far as his new girlfriend, Cynthia, is concerned, as well as all the others around her. He is pleasant, extremely handsome, and a real Mr. Nice Guy, and many think he is a male model or an actor. Standing six-foot-one, with a bronze, taut body from working at the gym, he is really eye-catching attractive, but he scored a job as a courier and enjoys it very much. After six months, his boss invites him to his daughters twenty-first birthday; and when he and Cynthia meet, the fireworks go off, and they are smitten with each other. 
Cynthia is brunette, beautiful, has a happy personality, has a good figure, and is the apple of her fathers eye. 
After meeting Cynthia, Evan asked her on a date the following week, and she accepted. Her brother, Lyle, came over from Egypt, where he has been travelling and met up with his school mate, Pete, who was also invited to the party and felt he also would like to see Cynthia as she had grown up since he saw her four years ago and gone from a plain, skinny teenager to this attractive, sexy young woman. 
Lyle could see the jealousy coming from Pete when she accepted the date with Evan, and from then on there were problems, and on New Years Eve, Pete decided that Cynthia is his and did something about it, which caused massive problems for the Preston and Andrews families as he abducted Cynthia, and no one knew where he had taken her.
 Time went by, and finally Cynthia was found and had to fight to live as she had not eaten a morsel in eighteen days, praying she would die knowing she could never be found where he had taken her. 
It was touch and go for her to live, and over a long time, she had to learn to live and walk again. 
This is a heartfelt story of what jealousy can do and how it can make someone unbalanced; how the people of Australia, thanks to the media, along with her family and friends, stood by her while she was fighting to stay alive; and how a deep, meaningful love triumphs all." />
