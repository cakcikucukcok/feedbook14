  <title>Three Fawn Moon - William H. Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Attempt of murder, murder, bullying, love, unsolved mystery, betrayal, hope, kidnapping, hope shattered, deep loneliness, more hope, hope lost, vengeance. Does it ever stop for these two kids?&lt;br&gt;
      Boy meets girl and they suffer betrayal, prejudice, love, indifference, rape, injustice, hope. How do they overcome this invasion into their everyday lives?&lt;br&gt;
     Bill suffers a brain injury. Hes blinded, he suffers stupidity.  Teachers taunt him. His classmates follow. &lt;br&gt;
     Cricket comes into his life and befriends him. She is an American Indian. They come together. He is eleven and she is ten. They share many adventures together. One time they both save a group of girls on a hiking outing and one reporter turns it around to make her the villain. Everything that is thrown at them they can fight off as long as they are together. Life sometimes doesnt work that way as the reporter continues his diabolical plot to rid this town of this one little Indian girl.&lt;br&gt;
     Her mom was on the run from her reservation and Phil, the reporter, stirs the pot and Crickets mom, to save her and Crickets life, have to leave town. Once this plot was set into motion it couldnt be stopped. &lt;br&gt;
     Bill has to find a way to live his life while Cricket has to find a way to save hers. While Cricket is in Texas being chased by three Indians, Bill, alone, knows what is going on with his visions of her and is powerless to help her. He meets Phil and has a confrontation with him.&lt;br&gt;
     Any romance Bill has leads to disappointment and more loneliness. Cricket is unsure of her life and struggles with the loss of her mom. Finds hope and loses it. She is alone and suffering. Though they are a continent apart he feels her sorrow but she has lost her spirit mother. The next choice is hers and she has to make it alone." />
