        &lt;p&gt;A stint as ranch manager on the Circle P may be the perfect way for Hank Judd to reconnect with his ten-year-old daughter. And selling his former girlfriend&#39;s family ranch will provide the cash he needs to restart his failed real-estate business. He just has to resist falling for the girl next door all over again.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Kelly Tompkins needs to sell her grandfather&#39;s ranch quickly to pay for his medical expenses and get back to Texas before she loses her chance at a promotion. Hank is the last person she wants to see, but she can&#39;t deny she needs his help. But spending time with the boy who let her down twelve years ago may unearth a heartache that has never truly healed….&lt;/p&gt;
