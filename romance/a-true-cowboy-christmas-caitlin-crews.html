  <title>A True Cowboy Christmas - Caitlin Crews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From&lt;i&gt; USA Today &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Caitlin Crews comes &lt;i&gt;A True Cowboy Christmas&lt;/i&gt;, the first in a sensational series debut about a cowboy, a farm girl, and the greatest gift of all. . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gray Everett has a heart of gold but that doesn&#39;t mean he believes in the magic of Christmas. He&#39;s got plenty else to worry about this holiday season, what with keeping his cattle ranch in the family and out of the hands of hungry real-estate investors looking to make a down-and-dirty deal. That, plus being a parent to his young and motherless daughter, equals a man who will not rest until he achieves his mission. Now, all Gray needs is the help of his lifelong neighbor. . .who happens to have grown into a lovely, spirited woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Abby Douglas, the chance to join forces with Gray is nothing less than a Christmas miracle. Much as the down-to-earth farmer&#39;s daughter has tried to deny it, Abby&#39;s been in love with stern, smoking-hot Gray her whole life. So when Gray proposes a marriage of convenience as a way to combine land--and work together toward a common cause--Abby can&#39;t refuse. But how can she convince Gray that sometimes life offers a man a second chance for a reason. . .and that their growing trust and mutual passion may be leading to true and lasting love?&lt;/p&gt;" />
