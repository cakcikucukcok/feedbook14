  <title>Betting the Scot - Jennifer Trethewey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Declan Sinclair wins Caya Pendarvis in a wager with her brother, he knows he&#39;s met the woman of his dreams. There&#39;s just one problem: she&#39;s been promised to another to pay off her brother&#39;s debts. It seems her nasty brother isn&#39;t above gambling away his sister. Twice. But Declan&#39;s not giving up the beauty. He&#39;ll have to convince her he&#39;s worth more to her than just settling a debt. Time to run through his rusty, and albeit limited, flirting skills, because it&#39;s time to win his lady&#39;s heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caya has no time for Declan and his ridiculous claims she&#39;s &quot;the one.&quot; She has to settle her brother&#39;s gambling debts, even if that means marrying a terrible man. Being a woman means not having a choice in the matter, doesn&#39;t this big oaf get that? But the more time she spends with him, the more she wants to tell her brother to go to hell and follow her heart. But she&#39;s met the man her brother is indebted too, and one thing&#39;s for sure: he&#39;s not going to let her go without a fight.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in The Highlanders of Balforss series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Tying the Scot&lt;br&gt;* Betting the Scot&lt;br&gt;* Forgetting the Scot&lt;br&gt;* Saving the Scot&lt;/p&gt;" />
