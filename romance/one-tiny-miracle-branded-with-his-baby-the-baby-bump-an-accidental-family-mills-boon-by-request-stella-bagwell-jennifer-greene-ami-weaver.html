  <title>One Tiny Miracle: Branded with his Baby / The Baby Bump / An Accidental Family (Mills &amp; Boon By Request) - Stella Bagwell, Jennifer Greene, Ami Weaver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;h2&gt;This little surprise may just bring them together… forever!&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Branded with His Baby&lt;/em&gt; by Stella Bagwell&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After her recent heartbreak, all Maura Donovan decides to nurse an elderly rancher, but then she met his grandson… Quint Cantrell was gorgeous, an impossible man to resist. But he was younger than her – and now she was having his baby…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Baby Bump&lt;/em&gt; by Jennifer Greene&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ginger Gautier does not need anything, especially not sexy doctor Ike Mackinnon. Ike had been enjoying his peaceful life – until Ginger changed everything. Trouble is, the feisty redhead refuses to listen to her heart. But Ike’s is telling him that they belong together!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Accidental Family&lt;/em&gt; by Ami Weaver&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Firefighter Ben Lawless is tormented by memories of the friend he couldn’t save, and pretty, pregnant Lainey Keeler is a distraction. As Lainey’s tempts him out of the darkness, he wonders whether he could have the family he’s always wanted…&lt;/p&gt;
