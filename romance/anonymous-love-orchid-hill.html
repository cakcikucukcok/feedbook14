      <meta name="description" content="AT 32 YEARS OF AGE, GRAYSON HUNTER BENTWOOD, III
WAS ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST MEN IN THE WORLD.
HE WAS RICH, GOOD LOOKING, AND SINGLE, BUT
HE ALSO HAD A SEX DRIVE THAT WOULD SCARE MOST
WOMEN. HE WAS ALSO A VERY DOWN TO EARTH PERSON
WHO BELIEVED IN FAMILY VALUES.
GRAYSON HAD BEEN ALL OVER THE WORLD, SEEN WOMEN
OF ALL COLORS, SHAPES, SIZES AND BACKGROUNDS. BUT IT
WAS THIS WOMAN, PARIS JOY SINCLAIR, WHO STIRRED HIM
THE WAY NO OTHER WOMAN, REAL OR IMAGINARY, EVER
HAD. WHAT WAS IT ABOUT HER. HE HAD TO FIND OUT.
THE MOMENT HE SAW HER, HE KNEW THAT HE HAD TO
MAKE HER HIS. HE DID NOT EVEN KNOW IF SHE WOULD
ACCEPT HIM FOR WHO HE WAS, BUT HE WANTED TO HOLD
HER, TOUCH HER, LOVE HER AND SATISFY THE FIRE THAT
SHE SET IN HIS LOINS. HE HAD TO HAVE HER IN HIS LIFE, IN
HIS HEART, IN HIS BED. FOREVER." />
