      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The next novel in Jamie&#39;s fantastic Mayhem series reunites lead guitarist, Shawn, with a girl from his past who is determined to show him what he&#39;s been missing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the moment she saw Shawn Scarlett perform at a school talent show, Kit Larson has loved two things: the guitar, and the gorgeous, green-eyed boy who inspired her to play. But one careless night in high school shatters her hope of ever being more than a notch in his bedpost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six years, two bands, and one mostly mended heart later, Kit&#39;s about to make her rock star dreams a reality as the new guitarist for Shawn&#39;s band, The Last Ones to Know.

But the past is paved with secrets, and when they finally surface, Kit could lose everything: the band, the music, her dreams... and Shawn.&lt;/p&gt;" />
