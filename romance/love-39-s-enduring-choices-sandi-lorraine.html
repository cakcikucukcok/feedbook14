  <title>Love&#39;s Enduring Choices! - Sandi Lorraine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Twenty five year old Cassie Foster grew up knowing that someday she would inherit her grandparents fifteen hundred acre ranch, and that they expected her to carry on with its legacy.  But, her staying on the ranch wasnt part of the plans that her high school sweetheart, Ethan King, had in mind for his future.  So, he had left her heart broken and vowing that she would never let herself be hurt again by falling in love with someone.
	But then Chad Benson, a half-blooded native American, walked into her life unexpectedly, and just happened to be on the scene the day her grandfather died.  She found him easy to talk to, easy to lean on, and easy to trust, so instead of searching for a hired hand to help her, she accepted his offer to become a partner in helping her manage the ranch for a share of the profits.
	The one thing Cassie hadnt planned on was the return of Ethan, with his intentions of winning her back, and doing anything that was necessary to make her give up the ranch so she would go to Colorado with him, which included creating conflict between her and her new partner." />
