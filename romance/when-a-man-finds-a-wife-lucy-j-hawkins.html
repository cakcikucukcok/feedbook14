  <title>When a Man Finds a Wife … - Lucy J. Hawkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the time she was four, Laura Simpson had one dream: to marry Richard Warner, a preachers son. But that dream was ripped away when she was sixteen. When she accepted Jesus as her Savior, Richard refused to have anything else to do with her. Instead, he turned to her best friend, Kathy Middleton. The product of an abusive home, Kathy was in search of love.  Richard happily exploited the wild and insecure Kathy, a young woman who was ready to latch on to his every whim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heartbroken, Laura forces herself to move on.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;However, when the truth comes outRichard is really in love with Laurashes at a loss. Hes been using Kathy and other women for practice, with the plan of saving Laura for marriage.  But Laura has moved on, and she now has two other romantic prospects in her life. And now that her integrity is questioned as an elder at Amberstone Baptist Church, a third prospect joins the field. The council of bishops sends Bishop Ralph Sessoms to investigate the accusations brought against her.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Is Ralph the one Laura was really waiting for?&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;As their lives and loves all hang in the balance, God intervenes  in a way that only He can.&lt;/p&gt;" />
