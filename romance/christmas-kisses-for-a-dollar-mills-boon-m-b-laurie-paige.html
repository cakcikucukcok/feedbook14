  <title>Christmas Kisses For A Dollar (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Laurie Paige</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;The one sale he couldn&#39;t resist…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As soon as rancher Jon Sinclair put down his twenty dollars at a kissing booth, florist Anne Hyden knew she was in for it. Mr. Sex-in-Pants certainly wasn&#39;t the type to settle for a quick little peck. But Anne wasn&#39;t expecting to actually &lt;em&gt;swoon&lt;/em&gt; in the guy&#39;s arms.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Anne had a problem. She had a heart condition that ensured her life was as dull and safe as it could get–and Jon was hardly &quot;safe.&quot; In fact, he was just the sort of guy to make a girl&#39;s heart give out altogether. And she still owed him nineteen more kisses….&lt;/p&gt;
