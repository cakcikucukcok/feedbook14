  <title>The Strongest Steel - Scarlett Cole</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Scarlett Cole&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Strongest Steel&lt;/i&gt;, Harper Connelly never expected to find herself outside of a tattoo parlor at one in the morning. The scars that decorate her back are just one more reminder of things she&#39;d rather forget, the past she wants to leave far behind her, but before she can move on, she needs &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tattoo artist Trent Andrews has his own reasons for specializing in inking over scars. And there&#39;s no way in hell he&#39;s going to turn Harper away. Not when a swirling mix of tenderness and desire slams into him every time he sees her. She stirs feelings in him he thought were long gone... if he can only get past her carefully constructed defenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As each session at Second Circle Tattoos gives Harper new ink to cover up old demons, it brings her closer and closer to Trent. His lingering touches seduce her, making her believe in a life without fear, where she can be happy, whole, in love. But when cryptic messages start appearing on Harper&#39;s phone, strange deliveries arrive at her door, and Second Circle is vandalized, Harper is convinced that her ex-boyfriend has tracked her down, and worse, that he knows about Trent. She ran from her past once before; this time will she have the strength to fight back?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This book gave me so many feels! Angst, passion, and love all set in Miami, my favorite city. I can&#39;t wait for more from this author and I can&#39;t recommend this book enough.&quot; - Sidney Halston, &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Against the Cage&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;An incredible story about healing, pain, and trust...you don&#39;t want to miss this one!&quot; --New York Times bestselling author Jen McLaughlin&lt;/p&gt;" />
