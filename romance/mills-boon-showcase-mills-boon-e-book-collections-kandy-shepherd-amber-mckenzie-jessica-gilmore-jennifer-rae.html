          &lt;strong&gt;Mills &amp; Boon Showcase&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Eight Super New Romance Writers’ First Novels&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;THE SUMMER THEY NEVER FORGOT by Kandy Shepherd&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sandy Adams is on her way to an interview, but when she sees a signpost for Dolphin Bay she decides to take a detour down memory lane….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ben Morgan has had his share of heartache. But when a ghost from his youth catches his eye memories of their last summer together come flooding back.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Everything has changed in the past twelve years, and still they’re right back where they started…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;RESISTING HER EX’S TOUCH by Amber McKenzie&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Surgeon Kate Spence is at the top of her game. But now her career is hanging in the balance, and the only man who can help her is hotshot lawyer—and her gorgeous ex—Matt McKayne!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Matt might have shattered her world, but now he’s her only hope. But to protect her heart she must resist the lure of a touch that still sets her on fire…!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;THE RETURN OF MRS JONES by Jessica Gilmore&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Of all the places in the world, Lawrie didn’t expect to be celebrating her thirtieth birthday here—in the sleepy Cornish town where she grew up. And she certainly didn’t expect to be celebrating it with her estranged husband, Jonas Jones! But his devastating smile and edgy good-looks still have the power to send her heart racing. And life is full of surprises.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;CONFESSIONS OF A BAD BRIDESMAID by Jennifer Rae&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Bridesmaid Olivia Matthews has arrived at her best friend’s glamorous society wedding—and stepped into her worst nightmare! From her cleavage to her attitude, nothing about Livvie is welcome—and before she knows it she’s won the disapproval of everyone there.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The only silver lining is best man Edward Winchester. He might be a bit uptight, but he’s also gorgeous and kisses like an X-rated dream.…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;RESISTING HER REBEL HERO by Lucy Ryder&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Dr. Cassidy Mahoney latest patient is notorious national hero turned bad boy Major Sam Kellan! Sam might have enough testosterone to whip all the women of Crescent Lake into a frenzy, but Cassidy is determined to resist his charms—she can’t risk her heart on another rebel!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;HOLIDAY WITH A STRANGER by Christy McKellen&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After three months of travelling, all Connor Preston wants to do is sink into his own bed. The last thing he expects is to find a stark-naked woman already there….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Josie Marchpane wasn’t anticipating company either. Connor may be six feet four inches of pure muscle and boast a disturbingly sexy smile, but a fortnight in the South of France is the one thing standing between Josie and insanity—and she’s not about to give it up without a fight!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;CHANGED BY HIS SON’S SMILE by Robin Gianna&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When ex-flame Danielle Sheridan arrives at Chase Bowen’s African clinic he’s captivated by her…and her little son! Three years ago Chase turned down Dani’s surprise marriage proposal—their life was just too dangerous for a family—but he didn’t know she was pregnant!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;UNLOCKING THE DOCTOR’S HEART by Susanne Hampton&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Fresh off the plane from London, Dr Beth Seymour hopes for a new start in sunny Australia. But she comes down to earth with a bump when she meets her fearsome handsome new boss, A&amp;E Consultant Matthew Harrison. Once playful and charming, heartbroken Matt is now distrustful and his demanding manner has his staff quaking! But could Beth be the key to his locked-away heart?&lt;/p&gt;
