          &lt;strong&gt;Making Amends&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After losing his clients’ lifesavings, former broker Rick Salinger, went in search of redemption. Now a pastor in the remote Canadian town of Churchill, he focuses on his congregation and working with the kids at a center for troubled boys. But when the center’s new nurse arrives with her own struggling son, Rick fears getting too close. Widowed mom Cassie Crockett once lost almost everything because of Rick—and he’s not sure she’ll ever forgive him. Yet he can’t stop his growing feelings for her. He wants to help Cassie and her son build a new life . . . one that just might include him.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Northern Lights: On the edge of the Arctic, love awaits.&lt;/strong&gt;
