  <title>Deception of the Heart - Montise Malone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Deception of the heart really deals with the deception of
online dating and how it plays on our emotions and heart.
Many women fall prey to romance and love between a man
and women through the multitude of elegant and beautiful words
you only dream about. I was able to gain first hand experience
through my own romance of deception online style. I loved deeply
and truly the man that said everything I wanted to here and more.
And how he took me down the road of deception through emails,
IM, phone calls and Skype and I didnt want it to stop nor did I want
to get off the roller coaster of romance and love I was experiencing.
I loved it and I wanted more and more." />
