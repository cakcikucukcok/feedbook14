  <title>In Emmylou&#39;s Hands (Mills &amp; Boon Superromance) (Taylor&#39;s Grove, Kentucky, Book 5) - Pamela Hearon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Will his secret be safe?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sol Beecher returned home from serving in Afghanistan a changed man. Closed off, he hasn’t opened up to anyone in years, and he certainly has no intention of doing so with EmmyLou Creighton. She, however, seems determined to get under his skin…and into his bed. Any other man would be thrilled to have the enticing EmmyLou pursue them, but a relationship with her means exposing his prosthetic leg. Thrown together at every turn, keeping the truth from her becomes increasingly harder—as does hiding his attraction. How can Sol trust his biggest vulnerability with someone who’s obviously hiding her own secrets behind that alluring smile?&lt;/p&gt;
