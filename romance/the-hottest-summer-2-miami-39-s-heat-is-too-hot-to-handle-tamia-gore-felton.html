  <title>The Hottest Summer 2: Miami&#39;s Heat Is Too Hot to Handle - Tamia Gore-Felton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It&#39;s not all fun in the sun this time around.   Almost a year later, Summer still has a bitter taste in her mouth from the break up with Trevor. Although she&#39;s in a relationship with Mark, she reaches out to Trevor for some much needed closure. After meeting with him, he answers her questions and an unhealthy friendship flourishes between the two.   After accepting gifts from Trevor, Summer realizes that things are getting out of hand and breaks things off, only to see a side of Trevor that she&#39;s never seen before. In the midst of the confusion, she receives a wedding invitation from Johaly. While mentally preparing herself for the event, she has mixed emotions about returning to Miami until Trevor sends her packing days earlier than expected.   Reuniting with friends and family seem refreshing until the reality of being a part of a wedding that&#39;s not her own sends her on a downward spiral. Meanwhile, Summer encounters drama with Imani and Lester that makes her want to cut her vacation short." />
