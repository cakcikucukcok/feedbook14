  <title>We Fought the Good Fight - Wendell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Its World War II, and Second Lieutenant John Stanley McCalla is leading a Filipino gun crew out of Bataan. The Japanese are coming close, and American-Filipino surrender is imminent. McCalla moves his troops to Corregidor, which soon becomes the next target on the Japanese rampage. Forced to flee, McCallas crew heads into the forest and prepares to use guerilla warfare against their enemies.
Its possible they could all die out there in the dangerous Philippine forest. In order to mount a particularly rugged hill, the team grasps hands and heads out in the dark of night. McCalla finds himself holding tightly to a small, soft handa hand that belongs to Third Lieutenant Isabel Ramos of the Philippine Nurse Corps. She fled with the soldiers, and now shes part of McCallas command.
The lieutenant cant believe it, but despite the horrors surrounding them and the threat of death by Japanese knife, McCalla finds himself falling for the beautiful Isabel. Perhaps it is the danger that holds them so tightly together. McCalla must keep his head clear; the war is certainly not over, and they are fighting a losing battle. Will reinforcements show up in time to save their lives, or will love die tragically on a conquered island?" />
