  <title>Rules for a Rogue - Christy Carlyle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kit&amp;#160;Ruthven&#39;s Rules (for Rogues)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;#1 Love freely but guard your heart, no matter how tempting the invader.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;#2 Embrace temptation, indulge your sensual impulses, and never apologize.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;#3 Scorn rules and do as you please. You are a rogue, after all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rules never brought anything but misery to Christopher &amp;#8220;Kit&amp;#8221; Ruthven. After rebelling against his controlling father and leaving the family&amp;#8217;s etiquette empire behind, Kit has been breaking every one imaginable for the past four years. He&amp;#8217;s enjoyed London&amp;#8217;s sensual pleasures, but he&amp;#8217;s failed to achieve the success he craves as London&amp;#8217;s premier playwright. When his father dies, Kit returns to the countryside and is forced back into the life he never wanted. Worse, he must face Ophelia Marsden, the woman he left behind years before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After losing her father, Ophelia has learned to rely on herself. To maintain the family home and support her younger sister, she tutors young girls in deportment and decorum. But her pupils would be scandalized if they knew she was also the author of a guidebook encouraging ladies to embrace their independence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Kit rediscovers the life, and the woman, he left behind, Ophelia must choose between the practicalities she never truly believed in, or the love she&amp;#8217;s never been able to extinguish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
