          &lt;strong&gt;Faith Hudson Was Falling In Love With Her Husband!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Her marriage was a disaster. Her husband was better off in Boston without her. It had been clear to her then, and it was even clearer now that she&#39;d traveled west and made her home on a Texas ranch. She had no plans of ever returning.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But Max Hudson wanted her back. It had taken him three years to find her, and he wasn&#39;t going home without her. It was a matter of principle.…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Until he realized he was more in love with the woman Faith had become than he ever could have imagined. And that love just might be what Faith had needed all along.&lt;/p&gt;
