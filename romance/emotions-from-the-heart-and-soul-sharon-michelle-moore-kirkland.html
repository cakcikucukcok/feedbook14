  <title>Emotions from the Heart and Soul - Sharon Michelle Moore Kirkland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Emotions from the Heart and Soul is the authors first book. Its about the emotions and feelings that each character experiences and stories that are being told. When you begin to read the stories you soon become the characters as you are drawn into their lives. Then there is that connection you start to feel with each one while experiencing their emotions. These are true feelings and emotions from the authors life of experiences. Putting these feelings and emotions into stories are a way of healing the pain of the past. By writing the stories, they describe some insight on the authors true feelings from the heart. She has added a little fiction mixed in with the nonfiction to entice your appetite for a good book. A great author never reveals her true source in writing a memorable book. I hope this book is an inspiration to all who read and may it bring you happiness." />
