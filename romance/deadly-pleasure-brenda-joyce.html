      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Brenda Joyce has enthralled millions of readers with her &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling novels. Now, join us in the next chapter of her unforgettable storytelling: the Francesca Cahill novels. Step into the glittering world of New York City&#39;s high society at the turn of the last century, where murder and pleasure are one and the same, and love becomes the ultimate weapon...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Francesca Cahill comes from one of New York&#39;s best families. Her mother is a leading socialite, her father, a millionaire. Their expectations for their daughter are simple-- marry well, and soon. But the intrepid and self-styled &quot;Crime-Solver Extraordinaire&quot; has other plans...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Francesca discovered she had a penchant for sleuthing when she met Rick Bragg, New York City&#39;s powerful and enigmatic Police Commissioner. Together, they solved what was known as the crime of the century. Now, their paths are destined to come together once again, but this time far more dangerously and fatefully. For Francesca is tempted to give in to the desire she and Rick have been resisting. And when Bragg&#39;s arch-rival Calder Hart arrives in town, a respectable man is suddenly found dead, and now murder is the name of the game...&lt;/p&gt;" />
