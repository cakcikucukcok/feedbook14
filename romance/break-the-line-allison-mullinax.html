  <title>Break the Line - Allison Mullinax</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As a pro-fisherman, Benson Howell&amp;rsquo;s days are spent on murky lake water, reeling in largemouth bass and winning first place trophies. At twenty-nine, life is easy and carefree. His only job is to stay in the top rankings during the fishing circuit, and keep the sponsors happy. That is, until he meets hot tempered, fiery haired Danni-Rose in small-town Alabama. He has never backed down from anything too big to reel in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Danni-Rose has spent the past six years of her life burying her past. When Benson Howell literally plows his boat right into her life, armed with simmering anger, she fights the current pulling her closer to him. With a past she can&amp;rsquo;t let go of, and the sexy fisherman breaking down all her walls, Danni-Rose does everything she can to break the line connecting her to Benson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will Danni-Rose be able to let go of the past?&amp;nbsp; Can Benson change her mind about him? Or will they both miss the catch of a lifetime?&lt;/p&gt;" />
