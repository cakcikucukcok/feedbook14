  <title>Nobody&#39;s Hero - j. leigh bailey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Bradley Greene&#39;s family all but discarded him when his brother caught him fooling around with another boy. Now Bradley has seventeen dollars and a gas card, and he&#39;s sleeping in his car. He’s an emotional mess and if he doesn&#39;t land a job soon, he&#39;s up the proverbial creek.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Danny Ortega can take care of himself&amp;#133;most of the time. When what started as a date turns into sexual assault in a dark parking lot, he&#39;s grateful for Brad&#39;s help&amp;#151;and an instant admirer of Brad&#39;s military school-honed muscles. He certainly doesn&#39;t expect to see him again, and definitely not as the newest hire at Ortega Construction.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;As Brad and Danny&#39;s quiet attraction turns into more, things start to go sour before they&#39;ve even started. Danny grows frustrated that Brad won&#39;t open up emotionally. And Brad is terrified of being responsible for someone else&#39;s feelings. When Brad&#39;s family makes one last attempt to turn him into an &quot;acceptable&quot; son, all bets are off&amp;#151;he and Danny will need to decide if they&#39;re in this together&amp;#133;or apart.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;74,000 words" />
