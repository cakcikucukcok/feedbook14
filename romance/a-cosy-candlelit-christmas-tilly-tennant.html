  <title>A Cosy Candlelit Christmas - Tilly Tennant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;All singleton Isla wants for Christmas is to be left in peace, but a surprise trip to the Alps means there&amp;#x2019;s a chance for romance in every snowflake that falls&amp;#x2026;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&amp;#x2019;s the week before Christmas and &lt;b&gt;Isla McCoy&lt;/b&gt; has just received an unexpected gift: a letter announcing she is due a life-changing inheritance, but only if she&amp;#x2019;s willing to make amends with the father who abandoned her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has absolutely no intention of forgiving him, but who could resist an all-expenses-paid trip to the French resort of St Martin-de-Belleville? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There she meets smooth-talking &lt;b&gt;Justin&lt;/b&gt; and nerdy glaciologist &lt;b&gt;Sebastian&lt;/b&gt;; two very different men, with two very different agendas. Torn between her head and her heart, Isla finds herself utterly lost in a winter wonderland of her own feelings. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Surrounded by twinkling candles and roaring log-fires, Isla&amp;#x2019;s resolve finally begins to melt. But will she learn how to reconnect, not only with a whole new family, but with herself and her heart?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A gorgeously heart-warming festive read to help spark a little romance in those long winter nights. Perfect for fans of Jane Linfoot, Debbie Johnson and Jenny Colgan.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;What readers are saying about &lt;i&gt;A Cosy Candlelit Christmas&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#x2018;&lt;b&gt;OOOOOOOOOHHHHHHH I LOVEEEEEEED IT!&lt;/b&gt;&amp;#x2026; Spell-binding, beautifully written and &lt;b&gt;100% memorable&lt;/b&gt; - Tilly Tennant has &lt;b&gt;blown me away&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;#x2019; &lt;i&gt;The Writing Garnet&lt;/i&gt;, 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#x2018;This is &lt;b&gt;my favourite Christmas book of the season&lt;/b&gt; so far, and I&amp;#x2019;m keeping everything crossed for a third book! &lt;b&gt;Fantastic characters, great story, beautiful setting&lt;/b&gt;&amp;#x2026; you could not ask for anymore! &lt;b&gt;Five Stars!&lt;/b&gt;&amp;#x2019; &lt;i&gt;Stardust Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt;, 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#x2018;&lt;b&gt;Cosy, sweet book that I adored!&lt;/b&gt; &amp;#x2026; Despite the freezing cold temperatures outside, Tilly Tennant&#39;s writing &lt;b&gt;will leave you feeling warm inside&lt;/b&gt;&amp;#x2026; It could easily be read at any time, although perhaps in front of a fire with a warm cup of cocoa would be ideal!&amp;#x2019; &lt;i&gt;Rachel&amp;#x2019;s Random Reads&lt;/i&gt;, 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#x2018;&lt;b&gt;Well this was an absolute gem!&lt;/b&gt;...
