  <title>The Unbroken Chains of Apartheid - Matsime Simon Mohapi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Before 1652 there were no labourers, no workers, no servants
and no servitude. All that was, was labour of love. Black people
worked their own farms. They were Masters on their own right. The
African land and its wealth gave our great grand parents the right to be
Masters. Black children are the children of Masters! They have the right
to know that the great are only great because we are on our knees! They
have the right to know because knowledge is power!
They must know that horrible accidents happened in South Africa
after 1652. Historical accidents did occur! Historical accidents which
were deliberate and were designed to put the destiny of a South African
Black child in suffering and poverty forever.
Then there was no poverty and no million orphans. There were million
cattle and million hectors of land. There was human dignity the
meaning of which was freedom from fear, hatred, and poverty.
Matsime Simon Mohapi, from: The Unbroken Chains of Apartheid
