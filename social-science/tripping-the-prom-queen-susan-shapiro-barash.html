  <title>Tripping the Prom Queen - Susan Shapiro Barash</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tripping the Prom Queen&lt;/i&gt; is a groundbreaking investigation into the dark secret of female friendship: rivalry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Susan Shapiro Barash has exploded the myth that women help one another, are supportive of one another, and want each other to succeed.  Based on interviews with women across a broad social spectrum, she has discovered that the competition between women is more vicious precisely because it is covert.  She tells us: &lt;br&gt;* Why women can&#39;t and won&#39;t admit to rivalry.&lt;br&gt;* How women are trained from an early age to compete with one another.&lt;br&gt;* In which areas women most heatedly compete.&lt;br&gt;* How rivalry is different among women than among men.&lt;br&gt;* The differences between competition, envy, and jealousy.&lt;br&gt;* When competition is healthy and when it isn&#39;t.&lt;br&gt;* Why women find it irresistible to &quot;trip the prom queen.&quot;&lt;br&gt;* Useful strategies to stop the competition and forge a new kind of relationship with other women.&lt;br&gt;Whether you&#39;ve tripped the prom queen or been tripped yourself, you will discover an engrossing exploration of this female phenomenon, as well as a beacon of hope for better, more fulfilling relationships.&lt;/p&gt;" />
