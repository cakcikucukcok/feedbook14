  <title>Deliberative Democracy and Social Movements - Andrea Felicetti</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Deliberative democracy is increasingly central in democratic theory and its concepts are employed in a growing number of fields, including social movement studies and environmental politics. At the same time, contemporary citizen activism seems to feature some forms of engagement that resonate with deliberative democratic ideas.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This book provides an in-depth investigation of the qualities of citizens&amp;rsquo; engagement from a deliberative democratic standpoint. The key concept through which such qualities are investigated is &amp;lsquo;deliberative capacity&amp;rsquo;, the extent to which organisations host authentic, inclusive, and consequential discursive processes. This book is based on a comparative study of four grassroots local initiatives, two from Australia (in Tasmania and Queensland) and two from Italy (in Emilia-Romagna and Sicily).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;By offering a critical assessment of deliberation in social movement organisations, this study identifies key aspects affecting their ability to pursue democratic deliberation and sheds new light on the role of community actors in deliberative democracy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
