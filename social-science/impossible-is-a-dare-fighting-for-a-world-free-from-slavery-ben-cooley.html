  <title>Impossible is a Dare: Fighting for a world free from slavery - Ben Cooley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ben Cooley was just 26 years old when he booked Birmingham&#39;s NEC Arena. He didn&#39;t have the first idea about putting on a major event. He didn&#39;t have a strategy, he didn&#39;t have the funds. But he did a have vision; a vision to live in a world free from slavery.   This is a story of passion turned into action.   In this book Ben shares the journey of Hope for Justice, from one man with a wobbly desk to an international organisation now rescuing victims in the UK, US, Cambodia and Norway. Featuring real-life rescues and the voices of Rend Collective&#39;s Patrick Thompson, Rob and Marion White, actor Tom Lister, Athena Pond and many others involved in the story so far, this book is about more than fighting slavery.   &lt;i&gt;Impossible is a Dare &lt;/i&gt;is a challenge.   What are you passionate about? What would you like to build or break or change? This book will inspire all readers to find and fight for their own vision and see the impossible for what it really is; nothing but a dare." />
