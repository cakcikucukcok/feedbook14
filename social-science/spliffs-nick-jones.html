  <title>Spliffs - Nick Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Spliffs&#39; offers a fun, accessible guide to everything you will need to know about dope and dope-smoking. The book begins with a short history on dope through history; the next two chapters provide guides to all the different types of grass and hash and to the various joint-rolling styles (both chapters feature specially commissioned, cut-to-white photos). Paraphernalia (from papers to pipes) is covered in the fourth chapter, while Chapter Five offers a fastmoving review of famous and infamous dopeheads through history, fictional as well as real-life. Chapter Six takes the reader on a guided tour of Amsterdam&#39;s famous headshops and cafes, and reviews the UK&#39;s own developing &#39;Cafe&#39; scene. The final chapter reviews the debates about the dangers/benefits of dope-smoking. The book concludes with an extensive glossary of terms and bibliography. Spliffs is produced in association with the world&#39;s leading magazine in the subject area, High Times. As well as the commissioned identification and &#39;how-to&#39; photos, the book features many archive pictures." />
