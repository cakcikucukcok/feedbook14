  <title>Artists, Obsessives and Chicago Originals: Selected Articles - Christopher Borrelli</title>

This book collects his in-depth profiles of celebrities, as well as profiles and commentary on everyday people he affectionately calls &quot;obsessives.&quot; The kind of folk who fascinate Borrelli can be workers at a local prop shop, carhops at the fast-food chain Sonic, or a video collective that has over 4,000 VHS copies of Jerry Maguire. But regardless of the quirks of a featured subject, Borrelli gives an illustrative and illuminating look into their true character&amp;#151;from celebrities we all &quot;know&quot; to cult heroes and veritable unknowns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Filled with entertaining celebrity Q&amp;A&#39;s, unique views on cultural phenomenons, and insightful takes on all things Chicago, Borrelli is one of the &lt;I&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/I&gt;&#39;s most enjoyable and humorous writers. His feature pieces are sure to offer inspiring perspectives on art, entertainment, film, found life, celebrities, and Chicago originals. This broad collection of Borrelli&#39;s best articles and commentary will appeal to his fans, Chicagoans, and consumers of pop culture across the country.&lt;/div&gt;" />
