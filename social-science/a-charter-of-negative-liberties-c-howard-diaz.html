  <title>A Charter of Negative Liberties - C. Howard Diaz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A Thorough Examination of Americas Liberties&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C. Howard Diaz analyzes Constitution and Bill of Rights in new book, A Charter of Negative Liberties&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While listening to a speech from President Barack Obama, C. Howard Diaz was shocked when Obama referred to the Constitution as a charter of negative liberties. Diaz explains that he couldnt believe a president of the United States would ever say anything like that. It was because of this that he started writing. The result? His new book, entitled A Charter of Negative Liberties: Defining the Bill of Rights and Other Commentary (published by WestBow Press).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In A Charter of Negative Liberties, Diaz breaks down the Bill of Rights in laymans terms and gives readers his explanations of how it, and the Constitution, are being misconstrued and abused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Im introducing the reader to the concept that the constitution and the Bill of Rights are documents that define political freedom and do not discuss any moral or social issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An excerpt from A Charter of Negative Liberties:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our forefathers, it is said, created the greatest document in the world when they conceived the Constitution. We the people in turn have spent the last couple of hundred years allowing a few to tear it apart with certain amendments and more recently with claims that the Constitution is old and outdated. Anyone who makes the claim that the Constitution is old and outdated is truly an enemy of the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Charter of Negative Liberties is a call to action for readers to learn more about the issues affecting America and raise their willingness to engage in a dialogue with more of an understanding of the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America has been tricked into believing our Constitution and Bill of Rights is somehow less relevant than it should be.&lt;/p&gt;" />
