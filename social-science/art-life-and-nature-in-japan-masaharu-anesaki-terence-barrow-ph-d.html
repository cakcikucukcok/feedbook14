  <title>Art, Life, and Nature in Japan - Masaharu Anesaki, Terence Barrow, Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;The artistic and philosophical heritage of Japan has a special meaning for the modern world. During the present century, Japanese thought and Japanese art have exerted a strong influence on the western mind. &lt;I&gt;Art, Life, and Nature in Japan&lt;/I&gt; takes us to the roots of Japanese culture and the origins of this influence.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In this brief but deeply meaningful book Masaharu Anesaki provides a panoramic view of Japanese culture, with particular emphasis on the spirit of Japanese art. The book has, in fact, established itself as a classic, and it ranks with such other valuable works of its time as &lt;I&gt;The Book of Tea&lt;/I&gt;, in which Kakuzo Okakura deals with a similar theme.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Anesaki expresses himself in crystal-clear English to convey a message that is significant today as it was before World War II, when his book first appeared. He advocates peace and a turning inward to the beauty of art and nature. He is as familiar with the Zen philosophy of the samurai and the tea master as with sentiments of ancient court noblemen and the quiet thought of a humble peasant.&lt;/div&gt;" />
