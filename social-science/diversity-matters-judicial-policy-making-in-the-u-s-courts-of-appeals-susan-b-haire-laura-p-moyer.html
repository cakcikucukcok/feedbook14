  <title>Diversity Matters: Judicial Policy Making in the U.S. Courts of Appeals - Susan B. Haire, Laura P. Moyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until President Jimmy Carter launched an effort to diversify the lower     federal courts, the U.S. courts of appeals had been composed almost entirely of white males. But     by 2008, over a quarter of sitting judges were women and 15 percent were African American or     Hispanic. Underlying the argument made by administration officials for a diverse federal     judiciary has been the expectation that the presence of women and minorities will ensure that     the policy of the courts will reflect the experiences of a diverse population. Yet until now,     scholarly studies have offered only limited support for the expectation that judges&#39; race,     ethnicity, or gender impacts their decision making on the bench. In &lt;i&gt;Diversity     Matters,&lt;/i&gt; Susan B. Haire and Laura P. Moyer employ innovative new methods of analysis     to offer a fresh examination of the effects of diversity on the many facets of decision making     in the federal appellate courts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Drawing on oral histories and data on     appellate decisions through 2008, the authors&#39; analyses demonstrate that diversity on the     bench affects not only individual judges&#39; choices but also the overall character and     quality of judicial deliberation and decisions. Looking forward, the authors anticipate the ways     in which these process effects will become more pronounced as a result of the highly diverse     Obama appointment cohort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
