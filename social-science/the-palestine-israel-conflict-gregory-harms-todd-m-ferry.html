  <title>The Palestine-Israel Conflict - Gregory Harms, Todd M. Ferry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Palestine-Israel conflict is the most notorious and ingrained conflict of the twentieth, and now twenty-first, century. Yet the way it is reported in the media is often confusing, leading many to assume the hostilities stretch back to an ancient period. 
The Palestine-Israel Conflict is the first book to provide a clear, accessible, and annotated introduction that covers the full history of the region, from Biblical times until today. Perfect for the general reader, as well as students, it offers a comprehensive yet lucid rendering of the conflict, setting it in its proper historical context. Harms and Ferry show how today&#39;s violence is very much a product of recent history, with its roots in the twentieth century.
This balanced account is now fully up to date, including the ongoing situation in Gaza, making it a valuable resource for anyone who wants a clear guide to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian territories, and its place in the history of Middle Eastern affairs." />
