  <title>Generation Priced Out - Randy Shaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The skyrocketing of rent and home prices was once only a story reserved for cities like New York or San Francisco, or some select affluent sections of other cities. But times have changed. In Los Angeles, Seattle, Portland, Austin, Denver, Cambridge, and many others, a generation of young people find themselves unable to live in the cities that long have been open to all.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;I&gt;Generation Priced Out&amp;#160;&lt;/I&gt;reveals how cities too often advance policies that increase economic and racial inequality, causing working and middle-class residents to become priced out. With all-too real stories of people impacted by the housing crisis, housing activist Randy Shaw analyzes the forces that led to this crisis, from city zoning laws, the role of &amp;ldquo;evil&amp;rdquo; developers and &amp;ldquo;bought off&amp;rdquo; politicians, or neighborhood groups opposing new multi-housing units. Shaw reveals the unique ways that Baby Boomers have affected Millennials&amp;rsquo; ability to afford housing, sharing their conflicting thoughts on building more housing, increased density, and single-family homes vs. multi-unit buildings. Shaw then offers 10 proven strategies for what can be done to the working and middle classes in the cities. Rising urban unaffordability is not inevitable. &lt;I&gt;Generation Priced Out &lt;/I&gt;provides a definitive blueprint for change.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;" />
