  <title>Dawn of Unity - John B. Leonard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;B&gt;Have you ever thought about the meaning of the phrase&lt;/B&gt; in Pres. Abraham Lincolns Gettysburg Address, where he refers to a government of the people, by the people, and for the people? The author believes that our present system  by allowing money to influence the process  is not truly a government by the people; but is rather a government by the wealthy elite, operating primarily for their benefit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The book proposes that for a government to truly be by the people, all people should have equal power, and play an active role in determining government policy. It further suggests that this can only be achieved when people unify into a structure of power (which the book describes), and let their governmental bodies know what changes the people collectively desire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The major portion of this book is dedicated to addressing areas of social concern; considering present policies from the standpoint of the underlying principles involved, and suggesting possible remedies or changes. The subjects addressed include industry (disparity in wages), taxation (on money and investments rather than income and purchases), money creation and control (governments responsibility inappropriately delegated to a private banking trust), imperialism (problems from using force rather than diplomacy to obtain needs), education (addressing childrens need for security, acceptance, and hope), law (restrictions upon personal freedom), justice (rehabilitation rather than retribution), welfare, and land ownership.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Together with these, the book proposes two protocols: one to remove the power of money and wealth from electoral processes and lobbying practices, and the other, an easy to implement procedure that will put all motivated individuals in control of decision-making processes within all governmental bodies (city, county, state, and federal).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Herein is a viable way for all people to obtain governance that truly serves all.  That way is through the power of cooperative unity." />
