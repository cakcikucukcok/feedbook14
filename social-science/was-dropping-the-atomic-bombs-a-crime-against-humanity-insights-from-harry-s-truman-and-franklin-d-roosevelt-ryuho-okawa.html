  <title>Was Dropping the Atomic Bombs a Crime Against Humanity?: Insights from Harry S. Truman and Franklin D. Roosevelt - Ryuho Okawa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Today, Japan faces several interlocking threats. The concrete threat of communist China&#39;s military expansion accompanies renewed threats to Japan&#39;s global image. We have seen a resurfacing of the fabricated claims that the Japanese Imperial Army used Korean comfort women in World War II, as well as false accusations that Japan conducted mass killings in the Nanking Massacre during the Sino-Japanese War. Historically, Japan has been portrayed as part of the imperialistic and fascist faction of the Axis Powers. The image of Japan as having an &quot;evil history&quot; has created a dangerously dire lack of self-respect in the Japanese people and Japanese leaders. It has contributed to weakening the Japan Self Defense Force even in the face of repeated military threats by North Korean missiles. Perhaps most importantly, this constructed image of Japan has formed the basis of the United States&#39; justification of its World War II atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Was there any true justification for these bombings? To answer to this question, Master Ryuho Okawa conducted spiritual interviews with Harry S. Truman and Franklin D. Roosevelt, the two presidents who presided over the United States&#39; participation in World War II. Could anything justify the use of nuclear weapons on civilians? Was Pearl Harbor really a sneak attack, or did Franklin Roosevelt know of it beforehand? This book reveals valuable information that will help the world gain a truthful understanding of world history.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What Are Spiritual Messages?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since 2010, Master Ryuho Okawa has published over two hundred spiritual messages, in Japanese, from the spirits of historical men and women and the guardian spirits of today&#39;s living figures. With this Spiritual Interview Series, Master Okawa is now making these important messages available in English. The books in this series are messages from the spirits or guardian spirits of people who have a great deal of influence over world affairs. These messages reveal these powerful figures&#39; hidden intentions and disclose facts that even news reporters would have difficulty drawing out. Master Okawa&#39;s in-depth analyses of these messages give us the tools that we need to understand and confront the dangers that lie ahead of us. Master Okawa hopes to show readers that the spirit world and spirits are real, and that by understanding spiritual truths, we can bring a peaceful end to international conflicts and create solutions to a variety of global crises. Master Ryuho Okawa, through his enlightenment, is capable of summoning any spirit from anywhere in the world, including the spirit world. The spirits that he has summoned have included founders of world religions, political leaders, and prominent economists. These messages are taped in front of live audiences, and many are eventually published. He has also given more than 2,200 lectures on his teachings. Master Okawa&#39;s way of receiving spiritual messages is fundamentally different from that of other psychic mediums who undergo trances and are thereby completely taken over by the spirits they are channeling. Master Okawa&#39;s attainment of a high level of enlightenment enables him to retain full control of his consciousness and body throughout the duration of the spiritual message. To allow the spirits to express their own thoughts and personalities freely, however, Master Okawa usually softens the dominancy of his consciousness. This way, he is able to keep his own philosophies out of the way and ensure that the spiritual messages are pure expressions of the spirit he is channeling. When Master Okawa channels spirits who do not speak Japanese, they are sometimes able to use vocabulary from his language center to communicate their spiritual messages in Japanese. In some cases, recently deceased spirits are only able to speak in their native language. In other cases, spirits who begin by speaking their native language gradually gain the ability to use Master Okawa&#39;s speec" />
