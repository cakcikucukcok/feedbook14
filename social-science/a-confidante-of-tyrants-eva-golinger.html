  <title>A Confidante of Tyrants - Eva Golinger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Confidante of Tyrants&lt;/em&gt; is a behind the scenes, exclusive insider view of the most &lt;br /&gt;
vilified and secretive world leaders of modern history. In the age of Trumpism, Eva Golinger&#39;s story &lt;br /&gt;
is a personal, revealing view of the rise and fall of a strongman who promised to buck &lt;br /&gt;
the system in favor of the masses and ended up setting the stage for the demise of &lt;br /&gt;
democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a very timely and relevant tale that resonates directly with the current political climate in the US and elsewhere and forewarns the dangers of authoritarianism disguised as democracy, strongmen leaders who harness cult of personality to accumulate power, and the seductiveness of bold promises to empower and elevate the invisible, forgotten underclass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet it&#39;s told from a very personal, intimate, insider perspective of what it&#39;s like to be an American woman who was innocently drawn to that type of movement and leader. Eva was behind the scenes of global power. She wandered the halls of presidential palaces, rubbed elbows with controversial world leaders, and was courted by unsavory regimes and declared enemies of her own country. She would come to know and even befriend some of these men, who so many in the world saw as tyrants. She saw them unveiled and had privileged access to Hugo Chavez, Fidel Castro, Vladimir Putin, Bashar al Assad, Muammar Gaddafi, Julian Assange and other vilified strongmen and U.S. enemies. She was a witness to their capacity to garner the attention and support of millions, and saw how they used it to create and expand their corrupt power. She was the only American woman to ever be a confidante to former Venezuelan president and &lt;br /&gt;
declared U.S. enemy, Hugo Chavez.&lt;/p&gt;" />
