      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;It began in New York City on June 28, 1969.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt; When police raided the Stonewall Inn&amp;mdash;a bar in the Greenwich Village neighborhood, known as a safe haven for gay men&amp;mdash;violent demonstrations and protests broke out in response. The Stonewall Riots, as they would come to be known, were the first spark in the wildfire that would become the LGBTQ rights revolution.
