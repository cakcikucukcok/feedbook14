  <title>A Broken Sausage Grinder - Hank Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THIS POLITICAL GUIDE HELPS US UNDERSTAND WHY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS DESIGNED AS IT IS AND HOW IT CAN BE FIXED.
Everybody proclaims disgust with the political system, yet the system continues to get more disgusting.  Is the hard-nosed partisanship in politics today the result of a flaw in the design of our system of government?  Did our forefathers overlook something important when they were writing the Constitution?
John Senger of Clarion Foreword Reviews gave this book FIVE STARS and said,  Much like Madison, Hamilton, and John Jay, the author is consistently reasoned and moderate in his arguments for restraint in the political forum.  In fact, he concludes: Our problem today stems from a loss of respect for the beliefs and ideologies of other Americans.
Kirkus Reviews said,  Thomas finally attempts to provide answers to the problems America faces, with such diverse advice as allowing only registered voters to make campaign contributions and stressing compromise over mere minority rule.  Thomas work is a compelling review of American political history in an easy-to-read form; a comprehensive set of appendices also aids the reader.
Designed as a tool to facilitate discussion, A Broken Sausage Grinder communicates the idea that we the people form the foundation for our government; if it isnt working as we intended, we the people have the responsibility to fix it.
Thank you for joining this important American conversation." />
