  <title>This Woman&#39;s Work - Osizwe Raena Jamila Harwell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This Woman&amp;#8217;s Work&lt;/i&gt; presents a social history and critical biography based on the life of award-winning writer Bebe Moore Campbell (1950&amp;#8211;2006). It offers the personal story of a popular novelist, journalist, and mental health advocate. This book examines Campbell&amp;#8217;s life and activism in two periods: first, as a student at the University of Pittsburgh during the 1960s black student movement and, second, as a mental health advocate near the end of her life in 2006. It describes Campbell&amp;#8217;s activism within the Black Action Society from 1967 to 1971 and her negotiation of the Black Nationalist ideologies espoused during the 1960s. The book also explores Campbell&amp;#8217;s later involvement in the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), her role as a national spokesperson, and the local activism that sparked the birth of the NAMI Urban&amp;#8211;Los Angeles chapter, which served black and Latino communities (1999&amp;#8211;2006).&lt;p&gt;Adjacent to her activist work, Campbell&amp;#8217;s first novel, &lt;i&gt;Your Blues Ain&amp;#8217;t Like Mine&lt;/i&gt;, connects to her emerging political consciousness (related to race and gender) and the concern for racial violence during the US black liberation period from 1950 to 1970. Similarly Campbell&amp;#8217;s final novel, &lt;i&gt;72 Hour Hold&lt;/i&gt;, is examined closely for its connection to her activism as well as the sociopolitical commentary, emphasis on mental health disparities, coping with mental illness, and advocacy in black communities. As a writer and activist, Campbell immersed her readers in immediately relevant historical and sociopolitical matters. &lt;i&gt;This Woman&amp;#8217;s Work&lt;/i&gt; is the first full-length biography of Bebe Moore Campbell and details the seamless marriage of her fiction writing and community activism.&lt;/p&gt;" />
