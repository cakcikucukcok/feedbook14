  <title>The Republic - Plato, GP Editors</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Plato&amp;#39;s &lt;strong&gt;&amp;#39;Republic&amp;#39;&lt;/strong&gt; is widely acknowledged as the cornerstone of Western philosophy, written around 380 BC. Presented in the form of a dialogue between Socrates and three different interlocutors, it is an enquiry into the notion of a perfect community and the ideal individual within it. During the conversation other questions are raised&amp;mdash;what is goodness? What is reality? What is knowledge?&lt;br /&gt; The dramatic date of the dialogue has been much debated and though it might have taken place sometime during the Peloponnesian War. It is Plato&amp;#39;s best-known work and has proven to be one of the most intellectually and historically influential works of philosophy and political theory. In it, Socrates along with various Athenians and foreigners discuss the meaning of justice and examine whether or not the just man is happier than the unjust man by considering a series of different cities coming into existence &amp;#39;in speech&amp;#39;, culminating in a city called Kallipolis, which is ruled by philosopher-kings; and by examining the nature of existing regimes. The participants also discuss the theory of forms, the immortality of the soul, and the roles of the philosopher and of poetry in society.&lt;br /&gt; This ebook has been professionally proofread to ensure accuracy and readability on all devices.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHOR:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Plato&lt;/strong&gt; is a Classical Greek philosopher, mathematician, student of Socrates, writer of philosophical dialogues, and founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. Along with his mentor, Socrates, and his student, Aristotle, Plato helped to lay the foundations of Western philosophy and science.&lt;br /&gt; Plato is one of the most important Western philosophers, exerting influence on virtually every figure in philosophy after him. His dialogue &amp;#39;The Republic&amp;#39; is known as the first comprehensive work on political philosophy. Plato also contributed foundationally to ethics, metaphysics, and epistemology. His student, Aristotle, is also an extremely influential philosopher and the tutor of Alexander the Great of Macedonia.&lt;/p&gt;" />
