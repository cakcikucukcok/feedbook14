  <title>Participant Recruitment and Retention in Intervention and Evaluation Research - Audrey L. Begun PhD, Lisa K. Berger PhD, Laura L. Otto-Salaj PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This practical &quot;how to&quot; guide integrates a comprehensive, interdisciplinary review of literature, alongside a wealth of the authors&#39; combined research experience, into a framework for behavioral health and other investigators concerned with successful participant recruitment and retention in intervention and evaluation research studies. The content applies across disciplines, provides numerous real-world and hypothetical examples, analyzes complex issues and ethical concerns, and provides investigators with concrete, practical tools for planning, budgeting, assessing, engaging in, analyzing, and reporting their studies&#39; participant recruitment and retention efforts. The book&#39;s focus is on application to intervention and evaluation research, and the authors present a great deal of information of contemporary relevance, including demonstrating an awareness of the opportunities and limitations of engaging research participants in an electronic age. In these ways, &lt;em&gt;Participant Recruitment and Retention in Intervention and Evaluation Research&lt;/em&gt; stands out from the fragmented published literature concerning participant recruitment and retention and from research methodology textbooks, many of which dedicate very little attention to the practical issues involved in successfully recruiting and retaining study participants in studies of these types." />
