  <title>Soldiering Under Occupation: Processes of Numbing among Israeli Soldiers in the Al-Aqsa Intifada - Erella Grassiani</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; 	Often, violent behavior or harassment from a soldier is dismissed by the military as unacceptable acts by individuals termed, &quot;rotten apples.&quot; In this study, the author argues that this dismissal is unsatisfactory and that there is an urgent need to look at the (mis)behavior of soldiers from a structural point of view. When soldiers serve as an occupational force, they find themselves in a particular situation influenced by structural circumstances that heavily influence their behavior and moral decision-making. This study focuses on young Israeli men and their experiences as combat soldiers in the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), particularly those who served in the &quot;Occupied Palestinian Territories&quot; (OPT) during the &quot;Al Aqsa &lt;em&gt;Intifada&lt;/em&gt;,&quot; which broke out in 2000. In describing the soldiers&#39; circumstances, especially focusing on space, the study shows how processes of numbing on different levels influence the (moral) behavior of these soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
