  <title>Power, Inc. - David Rothkopf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The world&#39;s largest company, Wal-Mart Stores, has revenues higher than the GDP of all but twenty-five of the world&#39;s countries. Its employees outnumber the populations of almost a hundred nations. The world&#39;s largest asset manager, a secretive New York company called Black Rock, controls assets greater than the national reserves of any country on the planet. A private philanthropy, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, spends as much worldwide on health care as the World Health Organization. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rise of private power may be the most important and least understood trend of our time. David Rothkopf provides a fresh, timely look at how we have reached a point where thousands of companies have greater power than all but a handful of states. Beginning with the story of an inquisitive Swedish goat wandering off from his master and inadvertently triggering the birth of the oldest company still in existence, &lt;i&gt;Power, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; follows the rise and fall of kings and empires, the making of great fortunes, and the chaos of bloody revolutions. A fast-paced tale in which champions of liberty are revealed to be paid pamphleteers of moneyed interests and greedy scoundrels trigger changes that lift billions from deprivation, &lt;i&gt;Power, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; traces the bruising jockeying for influence right up to today&#39;s financial crises, growing inequality, broken international system, and battles over the proper role of government and markets.&lt;br&gt;Rothkopf argues that these recent developments, coupled with the rise of powers like China and India, may not lead to the triumph of American capitalism that was celebrated just a few years ago. Instead, he considers an unexpected scenario, a contest among competing capitalisms offering different visions for how the world should work, a global ideological struggle in which European and Asian models may have advantages. An important look at the power struggle that is defining our times, &lt;i&gt;Power, Inc.&lt;/i&gt; also offers critical insights into how to navigate the tumultuous years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;" />
