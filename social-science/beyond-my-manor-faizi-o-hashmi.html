  <title>Beyond My Manor - Faizi O. Hashmi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail  Ralph Waldo Emerson
The above words sowed the seeds of Beyond My Manor. Believing in trying to make a difference, rather than merely complaining about the state of things, the author decided not to remain a silent spectator. His book originated from the conviction that every person through his acts and deeds directly or indirectly touches the lives of others. If that touch is positive, its multiplier impact on the society would be enduring, and he has humbly tried that. Many of the articles included in the book were published earlier in newspapers and magazines but have since been revised and updated. While endorsing civic law awareness, the author prescribes raising the bar of cost for violators of law. He suggests intervention for the needy and seeks support for causes that would bring about a Change. Essays have a wide angle including discussion on civil services, governance, integrity, work ethics, lack of nationalistic fervor, ills of unplanned urbanization, missing attention to civic responsibility and non-adherence to civic laws etc. But witty interludes are not neglected either, which add flavor to the book. Added to that is the authors selective reliance on Urdu and Hindi citations along with transliteration, sharpening the message. The incisive critical appraisals have been followed by suggested remedial action through citizen involvement. This ensures that readers are not left in the limbo about what next." />
