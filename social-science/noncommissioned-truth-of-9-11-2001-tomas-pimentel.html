  <title>Noncommissioned Truth of 9-11-2001 - Tomas Pimentel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Conspiracies Are Wrong  For too long the 9/11 conspiracy theorists and revisionists have had their day. It&#39;s time to put an end to the nonsense.   Angry and emotionally packed, Noncommissioned Truth of 9-11-2001 tackles, debunks, and blows apart the most insidious 9/11 conspiracies and alleged cover-ups, including:  •   That the World Trade Center towers were destroyed by a controlled demolition. •   That our air defenses were told to stand down after the attack. •   That a missile, not a plane, hit the Pentagon. •   That Flight 93 was shot down. •   That the hijackings were faked.  In a world clouded and distorted with misinformation and disinformation, Noncommissioned Truth of 9-11-2001 is a call to rationality by a naval expert, offering an unprecedented close examination of the inside workings of our government and military. This is an inside look at how the system works and where it failed as well as a blueprint for how to prevent or minimize future catastrophes that may befall the United States of America.  Straight from the gut, visceral, and no holds barred, Noncommissioned Truth of 9-11-2001 exposes the truth about 9/11 and torpedoes the ideas of the lunatic fringe. It is a must-read for anyone who has ever questioned how such an atrocity could have happened on American soil." />
