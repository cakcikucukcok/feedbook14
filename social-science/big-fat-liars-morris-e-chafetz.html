  <title>Big Fat Liars - Morris E. Chafetz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="These days, you can&#39;t turn on a television without hearing that you&#39;re probably fat, engaged in unhealthy behavior, failing to get sufficient exercise, destroying the environment through the use of practically every product that makes your life more convenient, and likely to fall victim to just about everything and everyone around you. But not only are the statistics that prove these points based on false information, much of our national dialogue is dictated by this patently bad science-encouraged solely by public and private organizations that leverage these demonstrably untrue facts to bolster their own philosophies and fatten their own pocketbooks. With mounds of solid evidence that contradicts common thought, Morris Chafetz shows the lies behind the facts about today&#39;s big issues (for instance, the &quot;obesity epidemic&quot; we hear so much about is the result not of a fatter population but instead a change in bookkeeping in a federal agency, and the evidence used now to frighten us about &quot;global warming&quot; was used a generation ago to frighten us about &quot;global cooling&quot;) and encourages readers to look through the money-motivated façade of statistics and government controls and return to a strong attitude of personal responsibility." />
