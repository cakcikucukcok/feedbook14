But in just a few short months, the once-promising career of Jesse Jackson Jr. has unraveled amidst investigations by the House ethics committee, speculation about an alleged attempt to buy Barack Obama&#39;s Senate seat from Rod Blagojevich, his mysterious medical leave that ultimately revealed his bipolar disorder to the public, and his recent resignation from Congress. &lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Jesse Jackson Jr.&lt;/I&gt; is a collection of the most captivating and revealing articles from the past 25 years of award-winning &lt;I&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/I&gt; political reporting. With fascinating background on Reverend Jackson and his up-and-down relationship with his son, this book delves the professional and personal lives of Jesse Jackson Jr. It is a straightforward, comprehensive portrait of his many successes and the shocking particulars of his recent scandals. &lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This book captures and contextualizes Jackson&#39;s impressive political career while serving as the best resource for investigative reporting on his ongoing legal, ethical, and health issues.&lt;/div&gt;" />
