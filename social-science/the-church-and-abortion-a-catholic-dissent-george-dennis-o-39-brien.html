  <title>The Church and Abortion: A Catholic Dissent - George Dennis O&#39;Brien</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This provocative book takes a critical look at what is increasingly viewed as the central political issue for Catholics&amp;mdash;abortion. From pro-choice politicians being denied communion to Democrats being called &amp;quot;the party of death,&amp;quot; for some of the most vocal Catholic leaders, the abortion issue often trumps all others. The author, a practicing Catholic who is against abortion in principle, believes the Church is on the wrong course with this issue, with grievous results for the Church and American society more broadly. He gives a brief history of abortion legislation, then explores the issue from legal, moral, and Christian perspectives, presenting compelling reasons why Church leaders and Catholics should stop trying to overturn Roe v. Wade and reconsider the issue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
