  <title>Morning Glories - Tracey A. Mash</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How can love hold one together in the midst of tragedy? Is there really a God out there that hears your prayers?
Morning Glories is an inspirational novel dealing with the acceptance of letting go and letting God. Understanding that no matter what is going on in your life, with God on your side, you will always come out victorious.
Morning Glories allows you to appreciate how precious life is and how quickly it can be taken away. You will come to the realization that God is still in control despite what anyone says or thinks. If you are willing to soften your heart and open your ears, you can hear Him ever so quietly speaking to you saying, My child this battle is not yours, but Mine. All he wants you to do is stand on His Word.
The manifestation of miracles that occur in Morning Glories will recharge your faith in God and encourage you in your lifes journey. You will know without a doubt, regardless of what it looks or feels like, in the end, God wins. Hes the Alpha and the Omega. The Author and the Finisher. Just put your trust in Him and He will show Himself true every time." />
