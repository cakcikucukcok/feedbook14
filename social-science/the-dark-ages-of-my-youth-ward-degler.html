  <title>The Dark Ages of My Youth - Ward Degler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Ward Degler graduated from journalism school, his mother speculated he would become a world-famous war correspondent or, at the very least, editor-in-chief of an influential newspaper. He did neither. Instead, he became a columnist, giving him the opportunity to write about subjects that interested him while avoiding everything that didnt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In &lt;i&gt;The Dark Ages of My Youth&lt;/i&gt;, Degler shares a selected collection of the weekly columns written for the &lt;i&gt;Times Sentinel&lt;/i&gt; in Zionsville, Indiana, from 1993 to 2010. The essays explore the way things were, where weve been, and where we are going. He reveals the challenges of an eight-year building project that was supposed to be completed in three months. He narrates his bafflement in dealing with the worlds most headstrong dog. With humor, he details the foibles and dilemmas of everyday living. And, he profiles the special people who have altered and enriched his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the simple to the complex, from the sublime to the silly, &lt;i&gt;The Dark Ages of My Youth&lt;/i&gt; takes a charming walk through both the past and present.&lt;/p&gt;" />
