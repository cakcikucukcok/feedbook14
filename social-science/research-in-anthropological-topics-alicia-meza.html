  <title>Research in Anthropological Topics - Alicia Meza</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The aim of this book is to present a varied research within the four sub-fields of Anthropology: Archaeology, Ethnology, Linguistics and Biological Anthropology,  as it was conceived by Frank Boaz. Perhaps my  emphasis has been mostly in Archaeology, since I specialize in the  Archaeology of Egypt and the Middle East. Nevertheless, I touch other topics as well. For instance sometimes I would connect archaeology and Egyptian art or literature and Egyptian linguistics. The total result has been a mixed of topics that relate in one way or another to Anthropology, the study of human behavior. Perhaps, if a student is looking for subjects to do term papers, or needs bibliography to start a research in a certain topic, this would be of help. I don&#39;t  pretend that my research is paramount, but there are some subjects and investigations that are unique, as any truly research should be. I hope that the reader enjoys the vast amount of creativity human behavior can produce." />
