  <title>The Sociological Souls of Black Folk - W. E. Burghardt Du Bois, Robert A. Wortham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;The Souls of Black Folk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is W.E.B. Du Bois&amp;#39; most famous work. While the work is often viewed as a classic in African American literature and the history of the African American experience, the sociological significance of the work has been understated. In his initial discussions with the book&amp;#39;s original publisher, Du Bois desired to prepare a volume that would showcase his ongoing sociological work on &amp;quot;the Negro problems.&amp;quot; While many editions of Du Bois&amp;#39; classic text have appeared, no edition has focused primarily on the eight previously published essays in their original form and chronological order. This fact alone makes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;The Sociological Souls of Black Folk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; unique. An introductory essay by the volume&amp;#39;s editor, Robert Wortham, highlights the sociological significance of the original essays by addressing such themes as the concept of the self, the social construction of the African American experience, and racial inequality. Eight additional essays originally published between 1897 and 1900 are added by the editor in a second section. These additional sociological essays focus on African American entrepreneurship, crime, race relations, liberal arts education, the Black Church&amp;#39;s function within the African American community, and the quality of African American life in the Southern Black Belt. The essays included in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;The Sociological Souls of Black Folk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; provide the reader with an opportunity to gain a greater appreciation for Du Bois&amp;#39; early sociological work and recognize that Du Bois was indeed one of the pioneering figures in the development of sociology in the United States.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
