  <title>&quot;If You Can&#39;t Be Better Than an N-Word, Then Who Can You Be Better Than?&quot; - Thomas Sass</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Americas elites utilize the divide-and-conquer strategy, and with African Americans, they have found their first target. Centuries of brainwashing have instilled a superiority high in many whites and at the same time placed blacks in less-than positions.
I intend to show to what extent Apartheidism and the less-than culture affect blacks in several different environments, such as how the criminal justice system is used to marginalize and criminalize blacks at rates disproportionate to their population. Even the sports world can be more problematic for blacks than for non-blacks.
I will present people and events that will show the double standards society has been led to not only accept but to expect, and just how easily we seem to have been manipulated. Most, and perhaps none of which could have been so relatively easily accomplished if the drug of superiority did not cloud our perceptions." />
