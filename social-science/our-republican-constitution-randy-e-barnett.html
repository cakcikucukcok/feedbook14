  <title>Our Republican Constitution - Randy E. Barnett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A concise history of the long struggle between two fundamentally opposing constitutional traditions, from one of the nation&amp;#8217;s leading constitutional scholars&amp;#8212;a manifesto for renewing our constitutional republic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Constitution of the United States begins with the words: &amp;#8220;We the People.&amp;#8221; But from the earliest days of the American republic, there have been two competing notions of &amp;#8220;the People,&amp;#8221; which lead to two very different visions of the Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who view &amp;#8220;We the People&amp;#8221; collectively think popular sovereignty resides in the people as a group, which leads them to favor a &amp;#8220;democratic&amp;#8221; constitution that allows the &amp;#8220;will of the people&amp;#8221; to be expressed by majority rule. In contrast, those who think popular sovereignty resides in the people as individuals contend that a &amp;#8220;republican&amp;#8221; constitution is needed to secure the pre-existing inalienable rights of &amp;#8220;We the People,&amp;#8221; each and every one, against abuses by the majority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Our Republican Constitution, renowned legal scholar Randy E. Barnett tells the fascinating story of how this debate arose shortly after the Revolution, leading to the adoption of a new and innovative &amp;#8220;republican&amp;#8221; constitution; and how the struggle over slavery led to its completion by a newly formed Republican Party. Yet soon thereafter, progressive academics and activists urged the courts to remake our Republican Constitution into a democratic one by ignoring key passes of its text. Eventually, the courts complied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing from his deep knowledge of constitutional law and history, as well as his experience litigating on behalf of medical marijuana and against Obamacare, Barnett explains why &amp;#8220;We the People&amp;#8221; would greatly benefit from the renewal of our Republican Constitution, and how this can be accomplished in the courts and the political arena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
