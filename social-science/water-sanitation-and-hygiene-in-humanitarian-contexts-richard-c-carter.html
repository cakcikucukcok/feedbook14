  <title>Water, Sanitation and Hygiene in Humanitarian Contexts - Richard C Carter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, droughts, disease outbreaks as well as conflicts are all crises that result in death as well as profound disruption to those left behind, and to those communities who shelter them. Among the most urgent interventions are those to provide water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) to affected communities. Water, Sanitation and Hygiene in Humanitarian Contexts presents contributions on the changing field of humanitarian WASH response and questions research and practice in this field. What are the research gaps in WASH response? What are the most effective means of providing clean water in different settings? How are the latest innovations in emergency sanitation performing? How can women’s menstrual hygiene needs best be met in humanitarian situations? 
The chapters address a wide range of WASH subjects, in a variety of geographical settings and are written by experienced practitioners and researchers.  The approach of the book is straightforward and practical, with little theory – the focus being on improving professional practice in the midst of humanitarian suffering.
This book is written for those whose everyday work involves humanitarian response to WASH needs in emergencies and disasters, but it is also aimed at development professionals from the WASH and other sectors, including researchers and practitioners." />

    	<p>Earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, droughts, disease outbreaks as well as conflicts are all crises that result in death as well as profound disruption to those left behind, and to those communities who shelter them. Among the most urgent interventions are those to provide water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) to affected communities. Water, Sanitation and Hygiene in Humanitarian Contexts presents contributions on the changing field of humanitarian WASH response and questions research and practice in this field. What are the research gaps in WASH response? What are the most effective means of providing clean water in different settings? How are the latest innovations in emergency sanitation performing? How can women’s menstrual hygiene needs best be met in humanitarian situations? The chapters address a wide range of WASH subjects, in a variety of geographical settings and are written by experienced practitioners and researchers. The approach of the book is straightforward and practical, with little theory – the focus being on improving professional practice in the midst of humanitarian suffering. This book is written for those whose everyday work involves humanitarian response to WASH needs in emergencies and disasters, but it is also aimed at development professionals from the WASH and other sectors, including researchers and practitioners.</p>
