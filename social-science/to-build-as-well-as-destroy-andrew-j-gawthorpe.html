  <title>To Build as Well as Destroy - Andrew J. Gawthorpe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;For years, the &quot;better war&quot; school of thought has argued that the United States built a legitimate and viable non-Communist state in South Vietnam in the latter years of the Vietnam War, and that it was only the military &quot;abandonment&quot; of this state that brought down the Republic of Vietnam. But Andrew J. Gawthorpe, through a detailed and incisive analysis, shows that, in fact, the United States failed in its efforts at nation-building and had not established a viable state in South Vietnam.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Drawing on newly opened archival collections and previously unexamined oral histories with dozens of U.S. military officers and government officials, &lt;I&gt;To Build as Well as Destroy&lt;/I&gt; demonstrates that the U.S. never came close to achieving victory in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Gawthorpe tells a story of policy aspirations and practical failures that stretches from Washington, DC, to the Vietnamese villages in which the US implemented its nation-building strategy. Structural factors which could not have been overcome by the further application of military power thwarted U.S. efforts to build a viable set of non-communist political, economic, and social institutions in South Vietnam.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;To Build as Well as Destroy &lt;/I&gt;provides the most comprehensive account yet of the largest and best-resourced nation-building program in U.S. history. Gawthorpe’s analysis helps contemporary policy makers, diplomats, and military officers understand the reasons for this failure. At a moment in time when American strategists are grappling with military and political challenges in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria, revisiting the historical lessons of Vietnam is a worthy endeavor.&lt;/P&gt;" />
