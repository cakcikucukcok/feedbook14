  <title>Mirror to America - John Hope Franklin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;John Hope Franklin lived through America&#39;s most defining twentieth-century transformation, the dismantling of legally protected racial segregation. A renowned scholar, he has explored that transformation in its myriad aspects, notably in his 3.5-million-copy bestseller, &lt;i&gt;From Slavery to Freedom&lt;/i&gt;. Born in 1915, he, like every other African American, could not help but participate: he was evicted from whites-only train cars, confined to segregated schools, threatened--once with lynching--and consistently subjected to racism&#39;s denigration of his humanity. Yet he managed to receive a Ph.D. from Harvard; become the first black historian to assume a full professorship at a white institution, Brooklyn College; and be appointed chair of the University of Chicago&#39;s history department and, later, John B. Duke Professor at Duke University. He has reshaped the way African American history is understood and taught and become one of the world&#39;s most celebrated historians, garnering over 130 honorary degrees. But Franklin&#39;s participation was much more fundamental than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From his effort in 1934 to hand President Franklin Roosevelt a petition calling for action in response to the Cordie Cheek lynching, to his 1997 appointment by President Clinton to head the President&#39;s Initiative on Race, and continuing to the present, Franklin has influenced with determination and dignity the nation&#39;s racial conscience. Whether aiding Thurgood Marshall&#39;s preparation for arguing &lt;i&gt;Brown v. Board of Education&lt;/i&gt; in 1954, marching to Montgomery, Alabama, in 1965, or testifying against Robert Bork&#39;s nomination to the Supreme Court in 1987, Franklin has pushed the national conversation on race toward humanity and equality, a life long effort that earned him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation&#39;s highest civilian honor, in 1995. Intimate, at times revelatory, &lt;i&gt;Mirror to America&lt;/i&gt; chronicles Franklin&#39;s life and this nation&#39;s racial transformation in the twentieth century, and is a powerful reminder of the extent to which the problem of America remains the problem of color.&lt;/p&gt;" />
