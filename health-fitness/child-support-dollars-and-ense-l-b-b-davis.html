  <title>Child Support Dollars and $Ense - L.B.B. Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Fiscal year 2010: over $175 million in child support payments could not be distributed to the children for whom they were collected! How big are undistributed collections this year? Is it possible that some of your child support payments ended up there? Where does the money go if not to the children? Show Me the Money!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In Child Support Dollars and $ense  Show Me the Money! Author Marty Vaughn addresses ongoing issues faced by many non-custodial parents as they pay support for their children. Issues include but are not limited to: overpayment of support, missing payments, arrears, improper tax refund interceptions and more.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;b&gt;Learn why&lt;/b&gt; 
Millions of dollars in child support payments are classified as undistributed and held by the government each year 
Some child support payments classified as undistributed may never make it to your child 
Many non-custodial parents are paying arrears that may not be accurate
Case monitoring and payment tracking are essential  
&lt;b&gt;Author Marty Vaughn also offers&lt;/b&gt;  
Powerful case summaries of other non-custodial parents and how they were resolved  
Step-by-step instructions for everything from case monitoring and payment tracking to how to address the child support enforcement agency
An entire chapter of FYI topics that every non-custodial parent should know  
Practical advice on how to protect the investment that is your child support payments  
&lt;b&gt;Ask yourself the following questions. &lt;/b&gt;  
&lt;br&gt;Are you absolutely certain that 
Your child receives every support payment you make?   
You have never overpaid your obligation?   
The amount of arrears the government says you owe is accurate?   
&lt;p&gt;When was the last time you checked your personal child support case? Three years ago? Last year? Never? If you are making child support payments you should consider those payments as important as you do deposits made to your bank account.&lt;/p&gt;" />
