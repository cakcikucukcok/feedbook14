  <title>Whitewash - Joseph Keon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;North Americans are some of the least healthy people on Earth. Despite advanced medical care and one of the highest standards of living in the world, one in three Americans will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime, and 50 percent of US children are overweight.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;p&gt;This crisis in personal health is largely the result of chronically poor dietary and lifestyle choices. In &lt;I&gt;Whitewash&lt;/I&gt;, nutritionist Joseph Keon unveils how North Americans unwittingly sabotage their health every day by drinking milk, and he shows that our obsession with calcium is unwarranted.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;p&gt;Citing scientific literature, &lt;I&gt;Whitewash&lt;/I&gt; builds an unassailable case that not only is milk unnecessary for human health, its inclusion in the diet may increase the risk of serious diseases including:&lt;/P&gt;  &lt;UL&gt;  &lt;LI&gt;Prostate, breast, and ovarian cancers   &lt;LI&gt;Osteoporosis   &lt;LI&gt;Diabetes   &lt;LI&gt;Vascular disease   &lt;LI&gt;Crohn&#39;s disease&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many of America&#39;s dairy herds contain sick and immunocompromised animals whose tainted milk regularly makes it to market. Cow&#39;s milk is also a sink for environmental contaminants and has been found to contain traces of pesticides, dioxins, PCBs, rocket fuel, and even radioactive isotopes.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;Whitewash&lt;/I&gt; offers a completely fresh, candid, and comprehensively documented look behind dairy&#39;s deceptively green pastures and gives readers a hopeful picture of life after milk.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;Joseph Keon &lt;/B&gt;has been a wellness consultant and nutrition and fitness expert for over twenty-five years. He is considered a leading authority on public health and has written three books, including &lt;I&gt;Whole Health: The Guide to Wellness of Body and Mind &lt;/I&gt;and &lt;I&gt;The Truth About Breast Cancer&lt;/I&gt;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
