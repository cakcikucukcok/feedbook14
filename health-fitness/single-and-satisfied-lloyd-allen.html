  <title>Single and Satisfied - Lloyd Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lloyd Allen believes that despite living in a society with a confused landscape of values and attitudes, singles and youth can realize their full potential. Having counseled, mentored, and interacted with singles and youth in various settings around the world, Lloyd is deeply conversant with human woes. The book addresses real issues with which singles are bombarded on a daily basis. It describes in clear and concise language the step-by-step process that a single person can take to escape the snare of sexual immorality, to rise above the cloud of broken dreams and shattered promises, and to behold the sublime rays of purpose, worth, and a meaningful existence. The book demonstrates:
 How you can be not just a coping single but a successful single.
 That your marriage is only as good as your singleness.
 Marriage is adult stuff.
 Why you should marry the right person, not just the convenient person. 
 That like fire in a fireplace, sex, when controlled, can be a benefit and a blessing. 
 Sex: a neurological understanding.
 Curb the urge.
 Sex is not cheap. It carries a price tag. 
 Finding healing after sexual promiscuity.
 Help for single parents." />
