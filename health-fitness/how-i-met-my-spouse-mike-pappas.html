  <title>How I Met My Spouse - Mike Pappas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a collection of twenty-eight amusing stories, Mike Pappas shares true tales from a variety of men and women that detail how they met their future spouse. 
Angelo has always been shy. When he sees a beautiful girl on the train one day, he must overcome his bashfulness and ask for her phone number. But what he does not know is that he has overcome only the first obstacle to winning her love.
Mary is working part-time as a cashier in a mens department when a huge fellow wearing a suit and tie asks her if she has a boyfriend. After he writes his number down on a cash register receipt, Mary must decide whether to call him or not. When a young woman goes against her fathers wishes and marries an immigrant, she learns it is always best to follow her heart, no matter what others say. 
After Dave pays for a girls coffee in Starbucks one day, he has no idea that she is going to forever change his life." />
