  <title>Toxin Toxout - Bruce Lourie, Rick Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;How do I get this stuff out of me?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Bruce Lourie and Rick Smith, two of North America&#39;s environmental leaders, have been asked this question on an almost daily basis since the publication of their runaway international bestseller, &lt;i&gt;Slow Death by Rubber Duck: How the Toxic Chemistry of Everyday Life Affects our Health&lt;/i&gt;. Their answer? It&#39;s not as simple as we&#39;d like, and it&#39;s not as easy as we&#39;d hope. But it&#39;s too important to ignore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Toxin Toxout&lt;/i&gt;, Lourie and Smith give practical and often surprising advice for removing toxic chemicals from our bodies and homes. There are over 80,000 synthetic chemicals in commerce today, and the authors use their outrageous experiments (they and their brave volunteers are the guinea pigs) to prove how easily our bodies absorb these chemicals. With trademark humor, they give us the good news about what is in our control, the steps we can take to help our bodies remove our toxic burden -- and what we can do to avoid it in the first place. Furthermore, Lourie and Smith investigate the truth behind organic foods, which detox methods actually work, if indoor air quality is improving, how we dispose of waste (where do those chemicals go?), and the ins and outs of a greener economy. The result is nothing short of a prescription for a healthier life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
