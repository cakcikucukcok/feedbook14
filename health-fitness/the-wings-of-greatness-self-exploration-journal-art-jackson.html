        THE VERY FIRST STEP IN GETTING THE LIFE YOU WANT ... IS DISCOVERING WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU WANT!
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        It has been said that the quality of an individuals life is directly proportional to the questions he or she asks him or herself. So we have generated
        the Self-Exploration Journal. The Self-Exploration Journal will take you on a self paced adventure in discovery and introspection. In this process, ask
        yourself the questions that will change your life. This journal contains the questions that have been generated through more than 15 years of
        counseling, executive coaching and platform speaking.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        These questions will cause you to reach deep inside to discover your purpose and what you were created to do. Order  and start your exploration today.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        As you work through your journal, you might try the affirmations at the end. You will find them having a beneficial effect on your thoughts, values and
        beliefs!
    &lt;/p&gt;
