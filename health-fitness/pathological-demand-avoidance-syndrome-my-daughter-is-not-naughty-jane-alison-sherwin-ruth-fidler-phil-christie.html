  <title>Pathological Demand Avoidance Syndrome - My Daughter is Not Naughty - Jane Alison Sherwin, Ruth Fidler, Phil Christie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jane Alison Sherwin&#39;s honest and uplifting account provides insight into the challenges of bringing up a child with Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA).        After years of misdiagnosis, Jane&#39;s daughter, Mollie, was diagnosed with PDA at the age of seven, and we follow her experiences pre and post diagnosis to age 10 as she attends school, interacts with the outside world and approaches adolescence. Throughout, Jane provides commentary on her daughter&#39;s behaviour and the impact it has on her family, explaining the &#39;why&#39; of PDA traits, including the need for control, meltdowns, obsessive behaviour and sensory issues. She reveals the strategies that have worked for Mollie and provides essential advice and information on obtaining a diagnosis and raising awareness of PDA. The book also includes an interview with Mollie.       Full of advice and support, and with a focus on understanding the child and how he or she sees the world, this book will be of immeasurable value to the parents and families of children with PDA as well as the professionals working with them, particularly teachers and teaching assistants, SEN co-ordinators, psychologists, outreach workers and social workers." />
