  <title>Traveler&#39;s Guide to Personal Security - Sam Rosenberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Its good to have a lifeguard, but its better to know how to swim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us can still remember a time when the most a traveler had to worry about was communicating with the cab driver or knowing when and whom to tip. Sadly, that age of innocence is long past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The globalization of crime and terrorism didnt begin, of course, with 9/11, but theres no question that the risks and uncertainties of traveland all areas of personal securityloom far larger in its wake. Not only are longer lines at airport security a fact of life for most travelers, but we also experience greater anxiety about the people we encounter and the situations in which we find ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main goal of this guide is to replace this anxietymuch of which is likely unfoundedwith a realistic understanding of what people and situations are (and are not) likely to pose a risk to your security and well being while traveling domestically or abroad. In its pages, youll find most of the common situations in which you may be placed at risk and learn how to spot the warning signals of an impending attack or crime, and more importantly- what to do about it!&lt;/p&gt;" />
