  <title>Why We Exist - Marc D. Garrett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Why do we exist? Where did the earth, sun, galaxy, and the entire universe come from? What is time, and does it even exist? Why does religion cause so much war? And in the end, whats the point of it all? While scientists, religious leaders, and historians have all provided insight into the origins of existence and the causes of major world events, often these explanations are at worst contradictory or at best inconsistent. However, without tricks or speculationand with some plain old common senseis there a way to discover the answers to questions about our existence beyond these different and widely held seeds of thought?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Why We ExistLife, Science, and More&lt;/i&gt; provides an uncommon explanation about the origins of existence that overviews and synthesizes conclusions from the life sciences, physical sciences, and religion. Using common sense logic to show how topics like gravity, time, the universe, and war are all interrelated and point to the existence of a so-called third entityan entity that must exist and of which everything is a partwe can walk away with a new and exciting knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answering these timeless questions about our existence can open our eyes and minds to a veritable new world of insight and inspiration. Taking this journey to discover fulfilling answers about why we exist will prove to be not only a fun and thought-provoking questit will also be both useful and meaningful to our continued lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
