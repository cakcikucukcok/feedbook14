  <title>More Than Expected - Gabriela-Elena Mech</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ema and Bruno, two young people who have their careers as their only refuge in the absence of a successful personal life, meet each other in Romania at the conference of the multinational company they both work for. She works in Bucharest and he in Zurich.
Although they meet for business, they start developing feelings for each other, and when they say good-bye in the airport, they both hope they will meet again. This happens sooner than imagined because the air traffic is blocked by a volcanic eruption in Iceland, and Bruno finds himself unable to fly home. The evening they unexpectedly come to spend together is the beginning of a beautiful story. But its thread is broken off by an unfortunate car accident that turns their lives upside down.
Exciting, likable characters come into scene with their own secrets, which will eventually come to the surface. Their attempts to properly set the level of their expectations on the frail border between the beauty of their dreams and the fear of losing them and getting hurt take the reader through a story full of unexpected turns, with joy and pain, hope and disappointment, love and restraint." />
