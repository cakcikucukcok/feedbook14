  <title>The French Art of Not Giving a Sh*t - Fabrice Midal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;It&#39;s time to stop giving a sh*t! &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Be calm... Stop stressing... Embrace the universe... Try yoga... Be fulfilled... and that&#39;s an order! We&#39;re overwhelmed with these sorts of commands, and we often torture ourselves to &quot;try harder,&quot; yet somehow we never feel we&#39;ve done quite enough. It&#39;s about time we stop pushing ourselves to do what we think we&#39;re &lt;i&gt;supposed&lt;/i&gt; to do, and instead simply allow ourselves to be angry, be tired, be silly, be passionate--to stop giving a shit, and just &lt;i&gt;be&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  An international bestseller (now in English for the first time), &lt;i&gt;The French Art of Not Giving a Sh*t&lt;/i&gt; by Fabrice Midal explains why the key to true mindfulness is freeing ourselves from social and often self-imposed stresses--and highlights how we can embrace life more fully by giving ourselves a break. He gives readers permission to:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Stop obeying -- you are intelligent&lt;br&gt;  Stop being calm -- be at peace&lt;br&gt;  Stop wanting to be perfect -- accept life&#39;s storms&lt;br&gt;  Stop rationalizing -- let things be&lt;br&gt;  Stop comparing -- be you&lt;br&gt;  Stop being ashamed -- be vulnerable&lt;br&gt;  Stop tormenting yourself -- become your own best friend&lt;br&gt;  Stop wanting to love -- be benevolent&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  One of the world&#39;s leading teachers of meditation and mindfulness, Midal offers us a new solution to the perennial problem of our too-much, too-fast modern life. It&#39;s OK, he urges us, to say &lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt;. It&#39;s fine to quit the things that don&#39;t fulfill you. It&#39;s necessary, in fact, to give ourselves a break and say, simply, &lt;i&gt;c&#39;est la vie&lt;/i&gt;. In &lt;i&gt;The French Art of Not Giving a Sh*t&lt;/i&gt;, Midal gives each of us permission to stop doing the things that don&#39;t make us happy ... so we have room in our lives for the things that do.  &lt;br&gt;" />
