  <title>EBK MOTIVATED TO SUCCEED - John C. Maxwell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who cares about a person&amp;rsquo;s attitude?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as someone can do the job, you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t worry too much about it, right? If John Maxwell believed that, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have Attitude 101 in your hands right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As America&amp;rsquo;s leadership expert, Dr. Maxwell has devoted his life to helping people become more successful. His books and seminars teach that anyone can be a REAL success if they master skills in four areas: Relationships, Equipping, Attitude, and Leadership. This book is designed to give you the essentials of attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People&amp;rsquo;s lives are so hectic. Their time is valuable, and yet, they are also on information overload. More new information has been produced in the last thirty years than in the previous five thousand. A weekday edition of the New York Times contains more information than average people in seventeenth-century England were likely to come across in their lifetime. The amount of information available in the world has doubled in the last five years, and it will keep doubling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this book, a companion to Leadership 101, Relationships 101 (available January 2004), and Equipping 101 (available January 2004), is the short course on attitude. Dr. Maxwell recognizes that as an individual, your attitude has a profound impact on your life. As a leader, you cannot ignore the attitudes of the people you lead and expect to achieve success&amp;mdash;whether you&amp;rsquo;re leading a business, a family, a sports team, or a group of volunteers. A person&amp;rsquo;s attitude impacts their relationships, colors their view of failure, and defines their approach to success. Attitude can make or break you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
