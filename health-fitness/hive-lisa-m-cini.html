  <title>Hive - Lisa M. Cini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is not just a book, its a MOVEMENT. Lisa did not choose to write Hive, Hive chose her. &lt;b&gt;Kute Blackson&lt;/b&gt;, transformational teacher and bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;You.Are.The.One.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four generations live under one roof in Columbus, Ohio, and theyve figure out to make it work: dividing responsibilities and chores, re-designing some physical spaces for privacy, and reconfiguring others into common areas for all to gather and enjoy living together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tale of heartache, heroism, and hope is one familys multi generational social experiment, which encompasses kids in their teens, parents in their forties, grandparents in their seventies, and a ninety-plus year-old great-grandmother. Together, as they navigate the joys and challenges that come with aging in America, theyre also answering the question, How does family help you thrive at home when youre old? An Alzheimers/dementia diagnosis adds a layer of complexity, yet the family resolves to keep their eldest at home for as long as shes happy, safe and engaged in life. The younger generation learns much from their elders, and the elders from their children. While mastering the use of technology and new family systems, theyre also mastering the use of humor, tolerance, and patience. Ultimately, thats what makes this four-generation experiment a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practical design advice and clear-eyed strategies are mixed with personal tips and observations, making it easy to see how anyone can transform their home in into their own multi-generational living situation. Her stories are honest, both funny and poignant. The familys fiascos are counterbalanced by their many successes, the greatest one being that as individuals and as a family, they continue to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;" />
