  <title>The Love List - Elena Murzello</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Elena Murzello cannot imagine going to the grocery store without a list. As she strolls through the aisles, she relies on her list to make sure she gets her must-haves and to help keep her from grabbing items she does not need. It was with this theory in mind that, at age twenty-one, she created a list of characteristics for a potential lifelong mate that still guides her love choices to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Love List&lt;/i&gt;, Elena shares her real- life experiences as well as information gathered from more than a hundred single, divorced, and married men and women about the qualities they look for in a life partner. Abstracting details from her interviews she created a process that anyone can use to create his or her own lists. Along with introspective questions to ponder, Elena includes sample lists of characteristics, the top three traits both men and women seek in a partner, an exploration of different types of relationships, and ways to diversify a portfolio of suitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Love List&lt;/i&gt; provides practical tips and personal stories to encourage single people to look deep within, take risks, and learn to rely on their own unique lists while searching for the perfect mate.&lt;/p&gt;" />
