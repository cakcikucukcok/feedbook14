  <title>The Third Way - Louis M. Houston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this day and age, people are challenged by an information-rich environment that is filled with erratic and inconsistent concepts. Added to the pre-existing struggle to adhere to societal and physical laws, we must struggle to control our own physical, emotional, and intellectual systems. By projecting the basic structure of physics into a psychological framework, we model disorganized behavior as a product of entropy or disorder. As heat energy is highly entropic, we propose that the exclusion of heat energy from our intellectual system reduces the intrinsic entropy in our thinking and promotes mental harmony. We refer to this method as the third way. Along with the exclusion of heat, it includes a balance between positive and negative mental energy that is fundamentally related to meaning and abstraction. This produces a still point and from the equilibrium of this still point emerges a positive overtone that we refer to as meta-positivity. The third way is so named in reference to the first way and the the second way. Essentially, the first way produces control of the physical system. The second way produces control of the emotional system, and the third way produces control of the intellectual system." />
