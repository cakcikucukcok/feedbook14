  <title>Parenting Children into Wholeness - Ann B. Makena</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Strong, Lifelong Relationships with Your Children along with Maximizing their Potential is a result of intentional parenting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Includes general parenting, single parenting, and advanced parenting. Focuses on raising great children, developing healthy and lasting relationships, and maximizing their potential. This brings fulfillment and wholeness in their lives, leaving you happy and fulfilled as a parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ann Makena has written a parenting book that is an exceptional balance of practical or real world strategies coupled with the equally important areas of emotional and spiritual well-being of both the caregiver and the child. She has an innate ability to distill the complexities of parenting into easily digestible concepts. This book is a reflection of her own personal story: amazing. heroic. virtuous. (Dr.Zaccariello, Michael J., Ph.D., L.P.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Parenting Children into Wholeness, Ann Makena has given us a rare look into the vital role of parents. It is rare in two ways. First, it places parents back in the empowered role God intended parents to have in a childs life as adults who carefully shape and develop character in a healthy atmosphere of loving discipline. It is also rare in being both a wonderful primer for new moms and dads and a deeply thoughtful refresher that encourages veteran parents in their crucial role. Highly recommended reading! (Pastor Jim Anderson, Senior pastor Harbor church Hastings, &amp; President of HNI)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ann Makena has written a manual for parenting that reflects her faith, her experience as a mother and the lessons she has learned from listening to and counseling others. There are many wise reflections on the fundamental principles of parenting. These can create a lifelong relationship with the child. A parent can give their child the wherewithal to live as a confident adult, with a sense of direction and comfort in the decisions they need to make. It is emphasized that even when good parenting is acquired belatedly, there is still the capacity to make changes for the better. (Dr. Galen Breningstall, MD Neurologist)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to Ann Makena for sharing your advice, wisdom, and experience with us again. Ann depicts the realities of parenthood, such as Being a good parent takes a lot of work. She utilizes her life experiences, joys/challenges as a mother, and her religious background as a chaplain to provide a framework for parents to build relationships with their children. She even addresses the challenges parents can face in different walks of life, such as single parenthood and parenting a child with special needs. (Dr. Anna Milz, MD, MPH, Pediatrician)&lt;/p&gt;" />
