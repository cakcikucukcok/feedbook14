  <title>Single, Saved, and Having Sex - Vernice Haliburton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Single, Saved, and Having Sex is not for the faint of heart searching for a spiritual look into helping their children or themselves deal with sexual pressures. It is about telling your children and yourself the truth and being honest. The book also takes a hard look into the reasons married, saved men and women cheat and how we as a spiritual community deal with those issues. This book is graphic, has questionable language, and may offend some, and for that I make no apologies. We are in bed on Saturday night with someone who is not our spouse though we are married, and our children are texting and using other social media to engage in sexual behavior that is unbelievable, yet we all get up the next morning and attend our places of worship as if the night before never happened. We dont talk to them for fear of exposing ourselves, and the lies go on and on. We pray, sing, and have a glorious time as the divorce rate and teen pregnancy rate climb higher and higher, all in the name of our God." />
