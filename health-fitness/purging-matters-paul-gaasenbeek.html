  <title>Purging Matters - Paul Gaasenbeek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jamie is in the midst of a crummy existence. Haunted by his nightmares, endless anxiety, and stress, Jamie hates his profession, entertains a dysfunctional relationship with himself, and wonders why he is living such a meaningless reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he lets the labels and generalizations reign over his lost identity, Jamie attempts to uncover the truth about himself while taking shots at big business, the environment, the government, and just about everything else that gets in his way. It is not long before Jamie realizes that everyone else is also trying to navigate through lifes dark and worrisome passages, terrified that one day they too will be just like himlost and alone. As he muddles through his socialized mind and mentally ponders the ideas of past and current philosophers, Jamie discovers that within the grand plan for his life, nothing is as it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this tongue-in-cheek story that will hit close to home, one man takes an unforgettable journey through reality and the challenges of living in a fast-paced, unfair world, ultimately realizing that there may be no escaping his nightmare after all.&lt;/p&gt;" />
