&lt;center&gt;Elisabeths Gift Reader Reviews&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;First, (the) book is extraordinary.  I got it primarily to learn about a time in Crete that I have only heard in broad generalities.  You do that very well and I can now better understand and visualize what actually happened at that time.  I had no idea what you personally went through.  Your descriptions make the moment come alive and they are emotional for the reader.  It is an exceptional experience.&quot;

Elisabeths Gift is a book that one does not leaf through it easily. Every page requires your attention. It wants to talk to you, to narrate an entire life

This book tells the story of his (John Psarouthakis) early life. It is the chronicle of an orphan raised by a wise and loving Aunt Elisabeth who recognized his great ability-and developed in him the qualities of disciple and character that turned nobility into accomplishment.
