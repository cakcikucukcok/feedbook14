  <title>Resurrection of Your Inner Hero - Jim Snyder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hes in therethe man you want to beor the man you want him to be. Really, hes in there. And Jims book is going to help you find him, and live the life you want to live as a man.  John Eldredge, author of Wild at Heart &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of time in the Garden of Eden, man has gone about building a new reality where he is king and controls all things. This flawed intention leads all of us into the dead ends of life where instead of fulfilling the illusion within our mind, we become more frustrated and unfulfilled. Through his excellent book, Jim shows us that the answer is not outside of us nor is it in us trying harder but instead in learning to loosen our grip and trust the only one who has all things under his control. This is a must read for you and all your friends.  Pablo Giacopelli, author of Holding on Loosely  and Leadership Coach &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many books intended for men are long on guilt and short on hope. Not this one! I was convicted, challenged, inspired, and given real life application to be the man God intends. Get this book!  Chris Wells, Christian speaker &amp; chaplain  for the BASS Elite Series &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passivity has been with men since the fall of Adam. While its a part of us, it doesnt have to be the dominant theme in our lives. Resurrection of Your Inner Hero provides detailed examples, illustrations, and explanations that can help men identify their areas of passivity, and the tools necessary to overcome. This epic reversing of Adams failure will set men free from the bondage of passivity, help guide them to be the men God wants them to be, and provide restoration to their marriages and families.&lt;/p&gt;" />
