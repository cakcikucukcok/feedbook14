      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a fun book of animated stories focused&amp;nbsp;on words or phrases misheard by those with a hearing loss.&amp;nbsp; The results are comical.&amp;nbsp; It also includes tips as to how to live with a hearing loss (your own or your partners or both).&amp;nbsp; The stories have been requested from across the US. There are colored graphics and easy-to-read content. &amp;nbsp;It is a perfect gift for those who are confused by a hearing loss or those that need to know how to deal with one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author has had a serious hearing loss (improved by two hearing aids) and wishes to share her experience with others who face this. &amp;nbsp;Advice has been sought and included from audiologists, others with a loss, hearing associations, and friends, &amp;nbsp;The result is a beginning introduction to the difficulties faced, their reasoning, and the direction one can take to receive help or to improve their communication.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was written with audiologist offices, doctors, consumers with hearing difficulties, and the general public in mind. The reader is encouraged to submit any stories or experiences they have related to mishearings to be used in a second edition. &amp;nbsp;this can be anonymous or submitted with a name attached. &amp;nbsp;thank You!&lt;/p&gt;
