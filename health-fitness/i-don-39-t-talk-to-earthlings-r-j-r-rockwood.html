      <meta name="description" content="Although diagnosed with Aspergers Syndrome, six-year-old Haley Haralson could read and write so well that he skipped the first and second grade. Before he was out of elementary school, he could repair computers and do complicated math problems in his head.
Before long, he had his own computer-repair business. In the evenings, he would stand by the streetlight and wait for customers to pick him up for repair jobs. At twelve, he slipped away from home and moved in with Fiona, a lady who ran a bordering house for college boys.
After his freshman year in college, he disappeared. His parents learned that Fiona had him declared of age and adopted him as her own son. He changed his name and severed all links with relatives, who never saw him again." />
