  <title>It&#39;s Your Hormones: The Women&#39;s Complete Guide to Soothing PMS, Clearing Acne, Regrowing Hair, Healing PCOS, Feeling Good on the Pill, Enjoying a Safe - Geoffrey Redmond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the renowned director of the Hormone Center of New York: complete cutting&amp;ndash;edge medical and alternative strategies for living happily with your hormones&amp;ndash;including how to enhance your sex life safely with testosterone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to Geoffrey Redmond, M.D., a majority of the 42 million American women between the ages of 35 and 55 suffer from vulnerability to their own hormones. Appearance, feelings&amp;ndash;and even sex drive&amp;ndash;may be affected. Symptoms include thinning hair, persistent acne, mood swings, low energy, loss of pleasure in sex, weight gain, irregular periods, and migraines. While the media has emphasized the problems of menopause, Dr. Redmond explains that many women experience hormonal miseries even in their thirties. Lab tests are often normal because the problem is not the hormones themselves but how a woman&#39;s body reacts to them. Healthy, active women suddenly find that once quiescent hormones are ruling their lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Because their problems are often dismissed as trivial, women who are hormonally vulnerable are frequently thwarted in their quest for help. Too often they are brushed off with remarks such as, &quot;Your tests are normal; there&#39;s nothing wrong with you.&quot; This is tragic because, as Dr. Redmond demonstrates, hormonal balance can nearly always be restored with the treatments he details, which include individualized use of prescription medications, herbal supplements, lifestyle changes, and even spiritual practices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many women have heard that testosterone can help sex drive, but most have not been warned about the damage that careless testosterone therapy can cause on skin and hair. In this book, Dr. Redmond, an internationally recognized authority on testosterone in women, explains the only safe ways to use testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With informative sidebars, quizzes, and personal stories of women who have overcome hormone vulnerability, this helpful book will empower you to find treatments for your hormone problems that are tailored to fit your own body, biochemistry, symptoms, and lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;" />
