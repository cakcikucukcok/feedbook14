  <title>Straight Talk - Gerry Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Finally! A Man Speaks to Men. Never have books promised to pry men away from their six-packs and remote controls to take a two-part course on the sport of seduction. As an author who has given new meaning to the word &#39;touch down&#39; , he shows you how to &#39;touch her&#39;. No subject is off-limits --- or out of bounds. So ladies, get ready to play ball!!
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;center&gt;Straight Talk: Volume One&lt;br&gt;
Playing For Keeps&lt;br&gt;
***How To Love A Woman And Make Her Love You Back***&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Round One - The Try-Outs&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In this first of two sizzling volumes, Wright gives raw tutorials on winning a woman&#39;s affections. In locker room voice former pro basketball player Gerry Wright answers all the questions that aspiring Casanovas are dying (but too proud) to ask. From what to wear, to how to smell, to how to equip the bachelor pad, &lt;b&gt;Volume I&lt;/b&gt; gets a man to first base ---without striking out.
&lt;p&gt;
Loaded with clever, hard-nosed information, &lt;b&gt;Straight Talk&lt;/b&gt; elevates men from sitting on life&#39;s bleachers as all of the quality babes walk by to becoming an All-Star at love.
&lt;p&gt;
Unlike books like &lt;b&gt;Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus&lt;/b&gt;, this two-book series deals with the real world, and gives the low down of what women really want --- in &quot;guy talk&quot;!
&lt;p&gt;
Crammed with nuggets of practical information spiked with sporting terms, &lt;b&gt;Playing For Keeps&lt;/b&gt; is savvy, sexy, and funny.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;center&gt;Straight Talk: Volume Two&lt;br&gt;
Papa&#39;s Got A Brand New Bag&lt;br&gt;
***A Man&#39;s Guide To Lovin&#39; His Woman Down***&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Round Two - The Knockout&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Volume I Straight Talk: Playing For Keeps&lt;/b&gt; got a fellow&#39;s foot in the door and into her head ---- &lt;b&gt;Volume II Papa&#39;s Got A Brand New Bag&lt;/b&gt; pitches step-by-step details on how to perform in her bed.
&lt;p&gt;
Gerry Wright, personal trainer and former pro basketball player gets straight to the point --- most men are lousy lovers. Perceptive, real and wise, in &lt;b&gt;Volume II&lt;/b&gt; Wrigt teaches men the blow-by-blow moves that leave a woman crying &quot;time-out!&quot; In the same no-holds-barred locker room style of &lt;b&gt;Volume I&lt;/b&gt;, Wright explicitly coaches mankind on the sensual techniques to win over the opposite sex.
&lt;p&gt;
Based on the shared experiences on different continents as Wright played basketball, he delivers the low down on the sexual &quot;left hooks&quot; and &quot;curve balls&quot; - that American women are dying for men to throw. More than a primer on body parts (and yes) oral sex the book also instructs men to listen to their partners.
&lt;p&gt;
Perceptive, clever, and graphic --- Wright&#39;s instincts brand him as America&#39;s personal trainer at love. Wright&#39;s hand size (a full 11 1/4 inches spread) afforded him the ability to earn &lt;b&gt;Sports Illustrated&lt;/b&gt; notoriety as a slam-dunk king. In two erotically raw volumes he gives tips that will have women in the palm of your hand (regardless of how many inches you&#39;re wielding). Wright&#39;s coaching a new team of men --- and, frankly fellows, she won&#39;t be trading you to another team after you read Wright&#39;s &lt;b&gt;Straight Talk&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Letter to Gerry Wright:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Dear Mr. Wright,
&lt;p&gt;
I went to a little book store called &quot;Consider The Alternatives&quot; on Thursday, April 19, looking
for a book about relationships.  I told Judy, the owner, that I have read many books to try to understand my man. And I couldn&#39;t seem to find one about women for men to read that wasn&#39;t just about sex. She called me at my home the very next day and left me a message that two books came in about the subject we were discussing and would I mind coming and taking them to read and review.
&lt;p&gt;
I went to the store the very next day and read the cover letter, then the contents of the books. I immediately took them home to read. I am 2/3 through Volume 1 and I can&#39;t put it down. You must promote this book every where. 
&lt;p&gt;
Your book is heroic to all of us who have been criticized for saying the things you had the
balls to say and say it straight. These two books must be marketed ASAP. Get the word out!
&lt;p&gt;
Thank-you so much for your gift to men and women. Your reward is very great.
