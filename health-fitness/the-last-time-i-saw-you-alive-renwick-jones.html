  <title>The Last Time I Saw You Alive - Renwick Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do you remember the last time you saw a certain family member or special friend alive? It might not be an experience you want to relive, but it can tell you some important things about yourself and others.
Author Renwick Jones &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; remember. He first encountered death when his paternal grandfather passed away. It then struck someone much closer to himhis brother, who died of sickle cell anemia. As the years passed, more loved ones died, and Jones also had to fight some serious health challenges of his own.
In this powerful memoir, he explores a wide range of internal battles as well as outside factors that affect everyone, including the role that hospitals play when someone becomes ill, the duties of funeral directors when death strikes, the special perspectives of chaplains, and the functions that cemeteries serve when someone dies.
Though death means absence, it gives you the ability to remember a loved one in any way that gives you the most comfort. Explore what death teaches us in &lt;i&gt;The Last Time I Saw You Alive.&lt;/i&gt;" />
