  <title>The Karma Chronicles Part 1 - Pepper Carlson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What if karmic debt is real and the powers that be are eagerly waiting to collect?
It is said we all have karmic debt and we get seven years to pay it back. We have a responsibility to settle these debts, hopefully learning from our mistakes so we dont have to go back to that chapter in the lesson book.
With good karma, we do good deeds so we will reap what we sow.
What about the price tag for bad karmic debt? Do we really have to spend seven lifetimes to get it right? In the first book of The Karma Chronicles, Hadrians Seal, a twin dies at birth and leaves her little sister behind to enter the combat zone. With her last breath comes the gift of ageless wisdom and divine intelligence. She mysteriously summons the archangels to help her and learns they were expecting her beckoning call all along." />
