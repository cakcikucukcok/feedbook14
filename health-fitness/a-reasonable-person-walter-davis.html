  <title>A Reasonable Person - Walter Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;In &#39;A Reasonable Person&#39;, Mark Dorsey applies all of his legal skills in a parade of trials representing clients being sued in quest of insurance company dollars. The story centers on Dorsey&#39;s attempts to find harmony in his professional and personal lives. While facing a never ending trial schedule, he engages in dramatic relationships with his loving and supportive wife, his childhood sweetheart who has become a demanding mistress and his gifted and engaging but somewhat irresponsible partner.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The story focuses on a series of cases each of which is an absorbing little drama, most of which are played out in courtrooms. As he meets with various challenges in his professional role, Mark also grapples with personal conflicts which threaten to destroy his marriage and his firm. As he is on the verge of making a potentially ruinous decision, a catastrophe occurs forcing him to see clearly what he must do. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;`A Reasonable Person&#39; reveals the world of insurance litigation in which justice may prevail if it is not prevented by mendacity, prevarication or incompetence. We see how attorneys who have mastered the intricacies of insurance law and are willing to make the effort to apply them will succeed on behalf of their clients. But as Mark Dorsey has discovered, achieving victory as a hired gun in the courtroom is not always gratifying.&lt;/P&gt;
