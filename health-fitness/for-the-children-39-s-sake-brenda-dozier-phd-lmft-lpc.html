  <title>For the Children&#39;s Sake: - Brenda Dozier PhD Lmft Lpc</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&quot;Dr. Brenda Dozier has been my number one choice for the referral of my most challenging couples and families. I am so glad that she has taken the time to share her wit and wisdom in &lt;I&gt;For the Children&#39;s Sake &lt;/I&gt;&quot;-Peggy Thorton, Ph.D., Licensed Psychologist&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&quot;&lt;I&gt;For The Children&#39;s Sake &lt;/I&gt; Dr. Brenda Dozier combined her  knowledge of child development and divorce by offering parents practical ways to lessen the pain divorce causes their children.&quot;-William L. Stutts, Ph.D., Licensed Child Psychologist&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&quot;This little book is a BIG, straight-forward primer that all parents who are divorcing must read!&quot;-Deborah L. Moffett, Ph.D., Psy.D.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Divorce hurts children. Divorce is ranked number two on the most significant life events chart. For children, teens, and college-age children, only the death of a parent is rated as more traumatizing. The degree of the pain, however, is related to the conflict between the parents. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;For The Children&#39;s Sake&lt;/I&gt;  will explain how children at all stages and ages deal with divorce. You will hear testimonies from children who have sat in Dr. Dozier&#39;s therapy office and those words of wisdom will help motivate you to parent together after the marriage ends.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Down-to-earth suggestions will help you determine when to seek professional help for you and/or your children." />
