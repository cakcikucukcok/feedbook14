  <title>The Appetite Solution - Joe Colella, M.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A weight-loss expert offers a new approach to eating which suppresses hunger and empowers readers to control their appetite, lose weight, and regain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Appetite Solution&lt;/em&gt; is weight loss specialist Dr. Joseph J. Colella&amp;#39;s aggressive six-week, three-phase plan to help you overcome hunger pangs, diminish cravings, and help you achieve your goal weight&amp;#8212;breaking free of the carbohydrate addiction that packed on those difficult-to-shed pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Colella begins by examining why we feel so hungry and introducing his &amp;#34;Appetite Scale,&amp;#34; a measurement that shows which foods lead to weight-gain and cravings. He offers advice for avoiding inflammatory foods or mitigating their effects by pairing them with other foods lower on the Appetite Scale. He then sets you on a prescribed diet that increases satiety, curbs your carbohydrate intake, and launches you on a journey that is forever free from an excessive appetite&amp;#8212;allowing continued weight loss without hitting a plateau or experiencing yo-yo weight gain and loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing on his unique understanding of diet and the thresholds that make losing weight increasingly difficult, Dr. Colella presents an aggressive plan for resetting your appetite, bringing your weight under control, and keeping you out of the body mass danger zone.&lt;/p&gt;" />
