  <title>Life Is Delicious! - Mary Luise</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mary Luise is a senior citizen who has discovered that life as an older person can be quite delicious! She had a vision from the time she was in her twenties of what being older might be likea beautiful vision that anyone could look forward to with great enthusiasm and delight!
Mary Luise breaks out of some of the old patterns and molds that have surrounded the lives and beliefs of older people and invites her readers to take a brand new, cutting-edge approach to life with a healthier, bolder perspective in mind. She does this by leaving behind things in life that are not serving a person very well and offering fresh and inspiring new perspectives.
What is left behind is replaced with new expectations of things that are lovely, good, healthy, happy, freeing, exciting, and powerful. She writes that it takes far less energy to be enjoying life than to be living a life that is not enjoyable because enjoying life is the natural, normal intention of living! Her ideas make new energy available for a dynamic life!
Mary Luise offers ideas and perspectives that have worked well and continue to work well in her life. She writes of change, music, love, forgiveness, gratefulness, dreaming new dreams, and setting new goals and so many more subjects that all lead the reader to a more deeply fulfilling existence!
Her desire is for her readers to be free to enjoy the same pleasures and satisfactions of life that she is enjoying in her older years. After all, health, happiness, joy, loving relationships and having fun are for every age!" />
