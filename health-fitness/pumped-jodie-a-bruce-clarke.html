      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you wish you had more confidence? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is something holding you back from bveing who you truly are?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Would you like to be equipped with practical techniques to help you THINK, ACT and LIVE as a confident woman?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her book &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pumped&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Jodie Bruce-Clarke uses her honest, playful and straight-forward approach to deliver a clear and invaluable message - that confidence is an achievable goal, which is available to everyone. Through insightful and inspiring stories, candid real-life examples and her own personal experiences, Jodie proves that confidence is not something that you are born with, or lucky to have - it&amp;#39;s something that you can create, to achieve the levels of confidence you&amp;#39;ve always wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll discover the elements of confidence, see how accessible they are and realise just how simple it is to apply them to your everyday life. And the best part? You can start making it happen right now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With specific guidelines to assist you with establishing and maintaining your own Personal Confidence Program, and in conjunction with the downloadable workbook, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pumped&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; offers relevant, practical and specific examples and techniques, which all women can relate to. You already have everything you need to get started and with this book, you&amp;#39;ll learn that increased levels of confidence can add value to every aspect of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the &amp;#39;no BS&amp;#39; approach to living a life you want and a must-read for anyone who is looking for a future filled with greater self-expression and self-belief, because...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#39;With Confidence, Anything is Possible!&amp;#39;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
