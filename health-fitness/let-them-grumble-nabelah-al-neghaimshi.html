  <title>Let Them Grumble - Nabelah Al-Neghaimshi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many hopes were destroyed in the beginning. Many initiatives came to an end before they even started. We did not give due respect to many great people. We gave more than they deserve to many trivial people. We have experienced many losses at times of colossal change because of ignorance and fear. Whoever wishes to transform from underdevelopment and consumption to development and productivity must make efforts proportional to these changes and must not exempt himself or herself from responsibility. The belief in our roles as individuals is a necessity for which we need a scientific leap, as well as a behavioral one in which we, as individuals, scientists, and our communities, participate. In helping you face your reality, I intend to be bold by displaying exercises, which vary in strength according to your need and position, to induce courage and effectiveness. You, dear reader, have the right to choose the most appropriate ones. 
As we live in one world in which our lives intersect with one other, any positive change in your life will inevitably affect others lives positively as well. It is a great service to render good for yourself first and the world second. In Let Them Grumble, I have displayed some of the backward causes to the lack of individual effectiveness in third-world countries. I call these the seven habits of the most underdeveloped and least effective people. I also include some of the stereotypes that have controlled our thinking for years and have hindered many people from realizing their dreams. Let Them Grumble is a battle for freedom in which our ammunition is courage. So get ready to burn your boat, stir up your courage, and let the critics grumble." />
