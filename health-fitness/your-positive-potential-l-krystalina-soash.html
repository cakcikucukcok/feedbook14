  <title>Your Positive Potential - L. Krystalina Soash</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Your Positive Potential: Action Steps for Self-Empowerment&lt;/i&gt; offers a compilation of personal life experiences, overheard stories, anecdotes, and insight with encouragement to overcome obstacles for a more productive life.
All adults have a past. Just the simple fact that we are alive today says that we have a past called, yesterday. We may classify our yesterday as years of experience, or we may classify it as one memorable experience in a single day  for example, a wedding day or a tragic accident. But one thing is certain, and that is that we cannot change our yesterdays, but we can make choices afterwards. 
As adults, we have the potential to change the results of our yesterdays, if we have the willingness to change them. Its a fact of life that wounds happen without our permission, scars result from those wounds, and how those scars are perceived determines our peace with ourselves.
Life is too short to settle for an unsatisfactory existence. Become proactive with your physical, spiritual, and emotional well-being for a more productive and fulfilling life.  Find self-empowerment and a new path in life through self-discipline." />
