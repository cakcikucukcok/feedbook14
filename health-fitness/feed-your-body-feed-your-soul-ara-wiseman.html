  <title>Feed Your Body, Feed Your Soul - Ara Wiseman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Wholesome food has healing properties, and when we purify our diet, a number of healing reactions may begin to arise from unresolved past experiences and strong emotions. These emotions get stored in our organs and connective tissue as emotional scar tissue, creating energy blockages that lead to pain. In &lt;i&gt;Feed Your Body, Feed Your Soul&lt;/i&gt;, author Ara Wiseman outlines how eating the right amount of pure nutritious food can help begin to release and eliminate these unresolved emotions we have stored and carry around with us. Our bodies are very forgiving, and when we stop our harmful habits and behaviors and replace them with healthier ones, nature can give us a whole new opportunity for a wondrous life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere deep inside we all yearn for emotional balance and hope to find peace with the most fundamental necessity of lifeour nourishment. Between the covers of this book, Ara shows us how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her book, &lt;i&gt;Feed Your Body, Feed Your Soul&lt;/i&gt;, Ara Wiseman gives us an intimate glimpse into her own journey towards wholeness. She provides the essential building blocks for good nutritive practices, but, more importantly, places this useful information into a wholistic context. In the process of developing her themes, Ara provides liberal sprinklings of philosophical spices and condiments to enliven the dish. These quotations, aphorisms, and affirmations from mystics and spiritual philosophers inspire us to take a loving look at ourselves and give us the courage to choose a nourishing and healing path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Anthony Godfrey, PhD, ND, author of Deep Immunity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ara Wiseman has written a multi-dimensional book that not only shows us the way to excellent physical health, but also the process of wholeness in relationships. Highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
