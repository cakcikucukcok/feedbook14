  <title>A Family Secret - Harry Brooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Family Secret&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is a fast moving novel that takes the reader from the streets of South Philly to the backroom gambling joints of Atlantic City in the early forties to the most Mafia-infested, politically corrupt city in the world  Las Vegas.  It is the story of two half brothers who each follow different career paths.  One becomes a successful Las Vegas casino owner, while the other ends up in the Mafia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The authors use of sharp street dialogue makes the characters as real as a royal flush.  A Family Secret is a gritty sometime humorous story that keeps the reader wondering what will happen next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You will meet all kinds of interesting characters in the book.  People like Fat Lenny, Little Pussey and Eddie the hat Weisberg, who is more like somebodys old grandfather than a Jewish Gangster.  The main character, Goldy, is the essence of every young mans dream.  Handsome, rich and as cool as a winter night.  And Bobby Cippolini, Goldys half brother, a careless, cocky young Italian who answers only to the face he sees in the mirror.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A Family Secret is a story about people as much as it is about gambling and the mob.  It is a beguiling and sometime witty love story that keeps the reader in suspense until the very end.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;!--Jewish gettos Mobsters Philadelphia Crime drama Jewish gangsters wise guys--&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;R E V I E W S! on Amazon.com&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Absolutely outstanding book! I found myself immersed in the characters&#39; lives because of the author&#39;s incredible attention to detail. The characters were very well developed and it incorporated aspects of business, the underworld, and family in a realistic portrayal of Mafia life. The plot kept me guessing... I couldn&#39;t put it down! Very highly recommended as it is now one of my favorite books!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;-  Stephanie Cohrac (Grand Rapids, MI) &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This book was one of a kind. A real pageturner!! It really paints a perfect picture on how life really was back then. A must read!! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;- A big fan, Jason Nissan&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The story takes you through a realistic portrayal of what it was like to be a wise guy in South Philly. The story flows well and the characters are well developed to give the reader a visualization of the story. The author is currently unknown, but won&#39;t be after people get a copy of this book. A must read!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;- Daniel Halpern (State College, PA)  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I was pleased to read a story that was true to life.No phony characters or make-belive &quot;:wise guys&quot;.The author knew what he was doing A great read.Can see this as a movie.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
