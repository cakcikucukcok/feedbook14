  <title>UPRISE: Back Pain Liberation, By Tuning Your Body Guitar - Dr. Sean Wheeler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What if everything you think you know about chronic back pain were wrong? Despite forty years of breakthroughs in medical science, patients suffering from chronic lower back pain are not getting better. When treatments fail, we must ask ourselves - what is fundamentally wrong? UPRISE shines a spotlight on debilitating chronic back pain and asks the big question - why aren&amp;#39;t patients getting better? The answer will shock you: your pain treatment is keeping you in pain. Drawing upon more than a decade of research and private medical practice, Dr. Sean Wheeler explores the interplay between pain, spinal instability, muscle weakness, and mobility that locks patients in a cycle of reoccurring pain. UPRISE offers a new understanding of the body as the finely tuned instrument that it is - as not only your body, but also your Body Guitar. The introduction of Tune Me - the new medical &amp;quot;orchestration&amp;quot; for your Body Guitar - is nothing short of a disruptive innovation in the understanding and treatment of chronic back pain. Tune Me helps patients stand together and UPRISE. By tuning your Body Guitar, you can regain control of your life so that those you love can again hear the unique, beautiful music your life is intended to play.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
