  <title>The Hardness Factor - Dr. Steven Lamm, Gerald Secor Couzens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A diet, exercise, and supplement regimen to help men achieve optimal sexual fitness&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sexual fitness goes hand in hand with overall health: Good sex means a man is most probably in good condition. The Hardness Factor is a comprehensive guide to sexual fitness for men, pointing the way to an enhanced self image, better sex, and improved health, and detailing how to increase sex drive and develop a measurably harder erection in just four days. The advent of Viagra and its competitors is a sign that we are entering a new era of male sexual health, in which erectile problems are glitches to be overcome, not sources of shame and anxiety. This is the first major trade book to identify and describe how to achieve and preserve optimal penile hardness—and to show why the actual degree of hardness is the all-important barometer of a man’s overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Drawing on the cutting-edge research that he has carried out over the past several years with his Digital Inflection Rigidometer, New York clinician and researcher Dr. Steven Lamm explains his revolutionary approach to achieving and maintaining maximal male sexual performance, with easy-to-follow suggestions that translate to not only better sex, but greater emotional intimacy and a longer and more fulfilling life. Dr. Lamm gives men all the tools and information they need to take control of their bodies, including health quizzes and a simple at-home test to assess one’s hardness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
