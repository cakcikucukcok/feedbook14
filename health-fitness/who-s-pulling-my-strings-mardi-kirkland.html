  <title>Who’S Pulling My Strings? - Mardi Kirkland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Mardi Kirkland resigned from a corporate management career to start her own business, she told herself she was a macho woman who could accomplish anything. Suddenly, instead, she was confronted with a far stronger belief about herself that threatened to sabotage her every move. While this awareness was shocking, she realized it had been running the show most of her life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you deal with your life once you learn that beliefs about yourself are fuelled by self-doubt and self-loathing, and not positive and loving?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While wanting to be an authentic person, she, instead, was consumed with thinking and saying what she thought others wanted to hear. She had no clue what being authentic looked like.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Willing to do whatever it takes, Mardi embarked on a personal journey to discover what had gotten her to this place, to heal her wounds, and create a new life based on self-love, acceptance, and joy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Whos Pulling My Strings? is an exciting, and sometimes painful, adventure from living as a victim of others whims to knowing and embracing life as the creator of her reality. Having been raised with the mantra, what will people think? had left her without a clue to who she really was and what was her truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cant help but become aware of your own lifes journey as Mardi shares her personal odyssey and the wisdom its twists and turns along the way taught her. The lessons learned are life changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KIRKUS REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;
2016-12-12&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A woman seeks to free herself from the lingering effects of a tumultuous past in this debut memoir.&lt;br /&gt;
When Kirkland confronted a change of careerfrom territory manager of a Fortune 100 company to beauty consultant with Mary Kayshe confided to a friend, I cant failbecause then everyone will know Im no good. It was a shocking revelation, and she began seeking answers that would help her achieve a sense of emotional wholeness. She first explored her childhood, during which she says her authoritarian parents taught her to fear a harsh God; she realized that this ultimately stifled her positive energy and convinced her she was no good. She writes that these feelings led her into two failed marriages in which she felt unloved and unlovable, and that they also motivated her to seek success as a way to cover up her insecurities. However, this book focuses less on her emotional trials and more on her recovery. Drawing on information from various workshops, books, and personal experiences, she details her coping strategies, such as studying her past and its consequences, reframing unhealthy thought processes, validating and exploring negative emotions, and learning to forgive others. One of the memoirs most appealing qualities is Kirklands excitement as she shares successes in her healing process. The book could have been trimmed down, as it repeats many ideas in different chapters. Overall, though, it flows very easily, offering astute commentary and excellent imagery. Readers may find that not all the coping strategies resonate with them, particularly the unconventional ones, such as having conversations with different parts of oneself or considering how ones birth story affected ones later life. However, there are many insightful ideas that readers may find beneficial, such as using criticism to learn about oneself and finding compassion for wrongdoers by considering their upbringings. Although Kirklands specific background is unique, the principles she shares are universal and worth a read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An engaging collection of coping principles for soul-searching readers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
