  <title>Polyamorous - Jenny Yuen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;A look at how people are giving themselves a choice to love another way — without cheating, failed relationships, or divorce.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
“The heart is not like a box that gets filled up, but expands in size the more you love.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Enlightened words you wouldn’t expect to hear from the computer in the movie &lt;i&gt;Her&lt;/i&gt;, but it also rings true for humans. More people than ever are exploring the possibility of opening up their relationships — and not only that, they are fighting for their legal rights to love however and whomever they choose.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
In &lt;i&gt;Polyamorous&lt;/i&gt;, reporter Jenny Yuen digs into why open relationships are such a hot topic, why they’re becoming more normalized, and how relationships with multiple partners can be a practical solution to mundane monogamy and an intriguing expedition through uncharted emotional territory. Couples are clearing a path for “throuples,” “quads” and “relationship anarchists” who navigate through jealousy and reach a place of “compersion” — feeling joy because your partner feels joy with another — as pairing off is no longer the default option for many. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Poly is love. Infinite." />
