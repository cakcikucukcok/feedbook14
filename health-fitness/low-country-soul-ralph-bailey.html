  <title>Low Country Soul - Ralph Bailey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="These are some notes, his father said shortly before he died, about a few things I dont want you to forget. Those life lessons became the substance of Low Country Soul and, when placed along side an account the life and times of an amazing man, the book becomes a compelling read. The Bailey family was steeped in the savory sauce of the Carolina low-country. Set on the islands of Charleston County, South Carolina, the story opens a window on life and culture during the war years of the1940s. It also gives entrance into the soul of the man. The Songs My Father Sang are like the Biblical psalms in which the writer praises God for life in whatever form it came to him." />
