  <title>My Son Went to Jail for Taking a Bath - Lorraine Holmes Milton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My eldest son served over twenty (20) years in prison for using a play, toy pellet gun that children use every day. I want the readers to know that it can be very dangerous for your children to play with certain types of weapons, &quot;play and toy&quot; included. It depends when, where and how the toy is being used and whom it is used on. 
One of my missions and goals are to educate parents and teenagers on the insensitivity of the &quot;NO TOLERANCE&quot; atmosphere in society. 
I missed 20 years of celebrating his birthdays, 20 years of not having grandchildren from him, etc. I am not negating the fact that he did something wrong, I am adamant about explaining that my son served more time in prison than some murderers - IT IS UNJUST! 
I served twenty-one years (21) in the military. I have good family core values and taught my son &quot;right and wrong&quot;; he was enrolled in character building activities, such as Karate, Track &amp; Field, Football, and he played music. If your teenager starts to make friends with peers that are going in a daunting path, then STOP! THINK! TAKE ACTION! In hindsight I would ask family members to have an intervention with my teen son. Your teenager will probably listen to his uncle, aunt, cousin or sibling when they will not listen to you. Take the appropriate action before it&#39;s too late.
&quot;Parents: please do not let your children play with TOY GUNS (plastic or pellet). It may land them in jail for twenty (20) years.&quot;" />
