      <meta name="description" content="These are my thoughts, feelings, and beliefs. They have come from my mind, down through my fingers, onto these typed pages that I hope will be read and understood by you. This was written as my wish to help deal with lifes issues with less pain and more peace.
Maybe these words will enable you to think in new ways and help you to see in a different perspective. You might be able to unravel that internal knot that has been kinking up your emotional balance all these years.
I believe the world is full of wisdom, and if we are smart enough and pay attention, we can acquire some part of it.
I know you may not agree with everything I have written, and that is all right. I believe the message you need will hit like an electric current. It will be the message that the universe has sent to you at this very time." />
