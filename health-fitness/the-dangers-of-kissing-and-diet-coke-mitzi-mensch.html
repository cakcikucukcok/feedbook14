  <title>The Dangers of Kissing and Diet Coke - Mitzi Mensch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What is wrong with Mitzi&#39;s head?  It all began in 1999 when a cat howling outside woke her up.  
Shocked, she realized the howls weren&#39;t coming from a cat, but from her!  Soon the loud nightly animal-like sounds were accompanied by major motor movements.  She was sent to &#39;Psych&#39; but her &#39;tics&#39; only escalated until Mitzi was placed on an antipsychotic which turned her into an emotional zombie and created devastating side effects.  In 2010 she quit taking her meds and reunited with her first love after a forty-eight year absence.  Goldie&#39;s kisses lead to a virus which results in a headache that never goes away.  Mitzi muddles through the morass of doctors, drugs and treatments as she searches for causes to and cures from the strange neurological symptoms that plague her.  Mitzi&#39;s medical mysteries and turbulent love affair are thought provoking and compelling, leaving the reader with a lot to decide." />
