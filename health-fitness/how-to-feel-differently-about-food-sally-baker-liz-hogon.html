  <title>How To Feel Differently About Food - Sally Baker, Liz Hogon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sally Baker and Liz Hogon, informed by helping thousands of clients achieve a sustained healthy approach to eating, have researched and written How To Feel Differently About Food to break the painful cycle of yo-yo dieting and emotional eating. The book cuts a clear path through the conflicting nutritional information that fills the popular media to reveal the best way to eat for improved health and enhanced mood, boost energy without triggering feelings of hunger and stop wildly fluctuating blood-sugar levels that lead to cravings.

Learning new ways of thinking and feeling about food will naturally enable readers to approach food differently. These positive changes are designed to be effortlessly integrated into a busy life with minimum planning and preparation, including how to eat for nourishment, become healthier, lose excess weight if appropriate, and boost mood as well as help to combat anxiety and depression." />
