  <title>How to Get the Grade Without Doing the Work - Charles Lanham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The one problem all students run into while they prepare for a test is not what you 
might think. You might naturally assume that the problem is one of memory (i.e., 
remembering the answers to the test), but the real problem is what I call the Situation 
Effect. In laymen terms, our intelligence is composed of two halves, the first being 
genetic, the second being environmental (e.g., diet, sleep, sociability, etc.), and these 
two halves come together to form our current situation. Therefore, effects on either of 
these halves can help make or break our grades.&lt;p&gt; 
The only way to improve your situation is to learn how to make your brain happy and 
comfortable, because when youre sad or stressed you will not function as well. In fact, 
some people are physically disfigured to a certain degree because they endured so much 
trial. In this state of mind, motor skills are frustrated and do not function like they 
should. Also, because of provoking anxiety, ability to fight disease is infringed. Above 
all, your focus, drive to succeed, and mental activity are all incredibly bankrupt. When 
theyre bad enough, it feels like they dont even exist. Therefore, if you keep yourself 
as happy as possible you will study more effectively.&lt;p&gt;" />
