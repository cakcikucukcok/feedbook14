  <title>The Girl with the Bible - Rená Curry, Sophie Mary</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book tells the story of Mary. She has a real testimony of the power of the human spirit combined with the power of the Holy Spirit. It is an uplifting journey through the mind and life of an addict. It is the story of a soldier who survives the trials of life. She triumphs over a past that most would not have made through. She shows her tenacious character in her resolve to be better. Her seven children are a testament to the saving mercy of God to help us overcome our circumstances. There was no way that a crack fiend could guarantee the safe delivery of those children and avoid serious birth defects. She looks back over her lifethe successes and failures. She records the ravages of addiction on mind, body, and soul. And she tells of the victory she found in Jesus Christ, her Savior. Take a look at how this American soldier overcame drug addiction and is now working for a treatment facility to help others live to tell a similar story. Take a peek at what God can do in a short span of time to help gain your years back. Be inspired! Be amazed! And be blessed!" />
