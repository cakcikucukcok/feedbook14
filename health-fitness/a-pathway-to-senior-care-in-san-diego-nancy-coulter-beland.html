  <title>A Pathway to Senior Care in San Diego - Nancy Coulter Beland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Choosing appropriate and quality care for you or a loved one can be an emotional and daunting responsibility. With the horrifying stories of senior neglect and abuse in newspaper headlines over the years, how do you determine between the good, the bad, and the ugly?
In A Pathway to Senior Care in San Diego, author Nancy Coulter Beland draws upon more than thirty years of experience in senior care to reveal the ins and outs of the industry. With anecdotes from her days in the dugout, youll learn how to:
	Have those difficult conversations with your loved one about power of attorney, driving, lifestyle preferences, and more
	Determine which care option is right for you and your senior
	Interview home care agencies
	Look for signs of quality senior communities 
	Work with Medicare, Medi-Cal, SSI, and VA benefits
	Make moving day easier on everyone
	Take care of yourself in the process
Beland understands there isnt a one-size-fits-all approach to senior care. She carefully lays out each option for different care levels and provides a wealth of resource information to be sure your senior obtains the best consideration possible." />
