  <title>The Vitamin Cure for Arthritis - Robert G. Smith, Ph.D., Todd Penberthy, Andrew W. Saul</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The general explanation for the cause of arthritis is that over time, our joints simply wear out - that is, the cartilage that lubricates the ends of the bones simply gets worn thinner and thinner until one bone wars directly on another, causing pain and lowering our quality of life. It stands to reason that wear and tear is responsible for some of the damage.It is considered a progressive disease, meaning that once the symptoms arediagnosed, they tend to get worse. Yet arthritis can be reversed. The process of degradation and regrowth in a joint is a dynamic process that continues throughout life. Arthritis results when the joint does not recover from damage. Most people may not realise it, but they have a direct influence on the current and future health of their joints through their nutritional behaviour. With the proper knowledge, we can prevent degeneration from taking hold by improving our body&#39;s regeneration processes. This book offers natural weapons we can use to defend and protect our joints from the destructive effects of poor nutrition and time. This clear, readable book describes the composition of joints and how they work within the body: how normal, healthy joints are supported and what can go wrong. It describes the degenerative diseases that affect joints and explains thebasis of orthomolecular (natural, megavitamin) medicine from a scientific perspective. There are several types of arthritis, but they all involve degeneration of the joints and tissues surrounding them. This book covers the different types, Including: * Osteoarthritis (OA) * Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) * Gout * Arthritis caused by infections or inflammation, such as Borreliosis (Lyme Disease), fibromyalgia and psoriasis * And more.THE VITAMIN CURE FOR ARTHRITIS explains each form of arthritis and current and new medical treatments forthem. More importantly, it describes the nutritional approach to help sufferers prevent further progress of the disease and even reverse it." />
