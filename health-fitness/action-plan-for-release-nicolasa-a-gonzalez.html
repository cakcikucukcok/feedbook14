  <title>Action Plan for Release - Nicolasa A. Gonzalez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a simple time management tool to help individuals with day-to-day goal setting that will help keep their focus on basic time management skills.
This helps individuals that have been recently incarcerated in county jail or prison to follow a plan of action that the individual has constructed themselves.
It provides a format starting from the day the individual is released from county jail or prison or thirty days prior to release.
There are time management tools arranged in a thirty-day calendar with mini goals to achieve. 
A workbook will ensure a functional plan of action with the needs of individuals at the time of their release back into the community with a resource packet provided.
The workbook will provide local resources for that county to help individuals reintegrate back into familiar, positive surroundings with local support.
The workbook will help individuals with places they need to go and people they need to contact. It will assist in achieving what the individual will need to accomplish to become healthy and productive members of society again.
The workbook is a self-help book to help with the first steps into getting a plan of action when released from incarceration." />
