  <title>The Solution to All of Humanity&#39;s Problems - The Secret to Creating the Life You Want - William Eastwood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From the upper echelons of the scientific establishment comes a completely new definition of reality and the human being. The most advanced physics in the world suggests that accumulated knowledge in all fields is based on a false premise. If so, all curriculum from grade school to university will need to be entirely overhauled. The end result will be a complete and total reversal of focus that will bring about a new human with entirely new and radical ways of achieving goals and solving problems. But we cannot do that while the pestilence prevents us and civilization from entering the promised land. Learn how to become powerful and unstoppable by having the right knowledge. We unknowingly wield immense power. We must recognize the fantastic power we possess and learn to use it constructively.  Here and now we have the power to work magic of such proportions we have never fathomed. Yet unseized, such power waits for us to claim it. It is of no use until we awaken to it. It is all here, in the solution." />
