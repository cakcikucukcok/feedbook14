  <title>Every Man is a Dead Man Walking: a guide to living with women, well . . . sort of . . . - WILL S NORMAN</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hello I&amp;rsquo;m Will,&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And I&amp;rsquo;ve written a book for men, all about women&amp;hellip;all the things that I think they need to know. However there is a problem - like a lot of men I started out clueless, and never really improved from there.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I speak as the authority&amp;hellip;the authority on failing miserably with women for most of my life &amp;ndash; if failing with women was an education, I&amp;rsquo;d have a PHD in it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All that said however, one day I found myself sort of on the shelf, and to my complete surprise some women took an interest in me. From this point onwards I set about trying to understand why.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I learned very little, but what I did learn people (women especially) kept telling me I should write in a book, so here it is, &amp;ldquo;Every Man is a Dead Man Walking, a guide to living with women&amp;hellip;well sort of&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; written with great care and attention by yours truly.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So if you&amp;#39;re a typical man who&amp;#39;s clueless about women, or a woman who wants an insight into the mind of a man, then read this book...my reviewers say you&amp;#39;ll learn something and apparently you&amp;#39;ll laugh in the process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
