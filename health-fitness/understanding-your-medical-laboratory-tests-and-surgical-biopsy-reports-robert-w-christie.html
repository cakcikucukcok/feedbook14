  <title>Understanding Your Medical Laboratory Tests and  Surgical Biopsy Reports - Robert W. Christie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This user-friendly book is written to help consumers understand medical clinical laboratory tests and surgical pathology reports. The orientation is toward patients with a medical problem, the worried well who probably dont have a problem, and the medical professionals and allied health providers who do not realize that a huge information gap exist between themselves and their patients. The chapter describing the shortcomings of laboratory test report forms is aimed directly at doctors, laboratorians, and other health care providers with examples of laboratory test report formats that can improve communication between the consumer, the clinical laboratory, and the health care provider.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;ADVANCE PRAISE FOR
Understanding Your Medical Laboratory Tests
and Surgical Biopsy Reports&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;A great resource for the lay population..... and everyone who works at our Clinic
should have a copy of this humorous, incisive look into the mysterious world of lab
tests!&quot; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Penny Durgin, A.D.N.P., Nurse Practitioner&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Great idea for a book! Im sure it will be a great help to patients trying to interpret their
lab test results, and it will surely be an aid to medial caretakers in discussing test reports
with their patients - and it will be on my bookshelf!&quot; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Elwin Falkenham, M.D., Family Practitioner&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;....the explanations of the lab tests make for fast, easy reading. I hope many doctors
and nurse practitioners will read it and learn a few things they really need to know in
dealing with apprehensive patients.&quot; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Annette McMahon, High School teacher&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;The reach of the subject of laboratory testing is really comprehensive. A reader can go
to whatever depth he or she chooses; many will find satisfaction in the informal style
and avoidance of medical language that is incomprehensible to patients.&quot; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;John L. Meyer II, M.D., FASCP, Community hospital Pathologist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Using this book, patients will be able to understand the significance of their
laboratory tests results. So often explanations from doctors in their offices are too
hurried, too technical, and too upsetting for patients to comprehend what their tests
really mean.&quot; &lt;br&gt;
