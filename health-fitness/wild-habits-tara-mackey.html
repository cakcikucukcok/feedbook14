  <title>WILD Habits - Tara Mackey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do you ever feel dissatisfied with your life or struggle with bad habits you can’t seem to quit? Are you finally willing to make the necessary changes to live a life you’re happy with? Is your intuition telling you that now is the time? In WILD Habits, award-winning CEO and biologist Tara Mackey brings you transformational healing techniques, showing you how to achieve complete body and mind restoration, by using her highly developed four-step WILD Method. Empowering success stories of Mackey and others, who have changed their lives one habit at a time, coupled with compelling scientific facts about mind-body connection, serve as powerful examples of easy ways that you can harness your life and release your true power.
WILD HABITS: Unlock Your Mind &amp; Unleash Your True Potential is a self-help book that highlights natural alternatives to commonly prescribed labels, pharmaceutical medications and Western therapies. Comparing clinical research, western/eastern philosophy and the author&#39;s own personal experience of 5 years sobriety from pharmaceuticals (after taking them for 11 years), this book will be a healthy dose of holistic health for anyone looking to improve their health or live their lives. WILD HABITS speaks openly and honestly about her struggles on prescription drugs, to her dangerous but determined decision to come off of them cold turkey in 2011, at the age of twenty-four, after a suicide attempt. This book provides resources for those wishing to take a natural route. By comparing common pain-killers, mood stabilizers and anti-anxiety medications and giving the reader their natural derivatives and healthier alternatives, WILD HABITS aims to open the public mind about why we are choosing this particular route for Western medicine." />
