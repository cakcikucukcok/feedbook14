      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a true story about the boy Shirley Curtis Rangell. He had a brother who shared many of his incredible experiences. At the time of his mothers death in 1925 his world changed drastically. From this time he never really had a home. He was eight years old and in the second grade. This was the beginning of a nomadic existence that defies imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his mothers death the two boys lived in very primitive conditions. The fathers work required many moves, so because of the constant change of schools, getting an education was next to impossible. The children spent most of their time alone and at one time they were completely abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life Begins at Eight is a tale of survival. This story emphasizes the impact teachers can have on their students. It tells of flexibility, inventiveness and adventures of a boy with no place to call home. It is inspiring at how and when the life-long dream of Shirley Curtis Rangell was finally realized.&lt;/p&gt;" />
