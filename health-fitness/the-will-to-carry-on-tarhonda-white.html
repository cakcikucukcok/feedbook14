      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever heard the statement, When I grow up, Im going to be a professional athlete?
&lt;p&gt;
Perhaps it was from your student, sibling, child or friend. Maybe it was from you.
&lt;p&gt;
Did it happen?
&lt;p&gt;
Has that dream become reality?
&lt;p&gt;
If not, do you, or the person you know have The Will To Carry On?
&lt;p&gt;
In this inspirational page-turner, Author TaRhonda White sheds light on many of the challenges young athletes experience. She explores their childhood disappointments, relationships with parents, leadership of coaches and triumphs from overcoming adversity. 
&lt;p&gt;
A former two-sport student athlete who rose from the disappointment of her own childhood dream, White extends stories of inspiration to the discouraged, hope to those still dreaming and knowledge about the unknown.
&lt;p&gt;
She shares advice from current and former athletes who also triumphed to achieve success. You will find answers from Tony Gaskins Jr., Glen Big Baby Davis, Britney Temple and more.&lt;br&gt;" />
