  <title>Divorcing, Understanding, Healing After an Affair - Evelyn George</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When I discovered that my husband had an affair, I was absolutely devastated. The betrayal was so painful and yet, I felt judged, blamed and ashamed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suffered strong, debilitating emotions that were difficult to express and handle. People didnt know how to help me and existing material was written by psychologists or long after the suffering point of finding out. No one talked about how it truly felt, or how to tangibly overcome the pain of divorcing when your spouse has already found someone else. I needed a way to heal and find myself again. I also had a strong conviction to forgive my husband and find love again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes - I was partially responsible for my marriage ending and my husband having an affair. But it was also not my fault nor was it right of him. People fall out of love  it happens. But too many people stay in a marriage for kids or a mortgage and forget about love. Love is what matters. And when its gone  problems creep in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book delves deeply and openly into how a good marriage can go so wrong. I share my raw feelings upon discovering the affair and the insight I gained as I analyzed, questioned, understood and healed. I give you honest and true ways to overcome the affair; to sincerely forgive your spouse; and to fully heal and improve yourself for a new relationship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book will help you see yourself, your spouse and your marriage in a new light. Whether youve had an affair, been cheated on or just in a marriage that lacks some luster  this book will change your perspective on marriage, affairs and divorcing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why I wrote this book: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Everyone whose spouse had an affair felt shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Marriage is a shared responsibility; but I didnt understand how the affair was also my fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; When I was really devastated, most people didnt know how to help me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Society scrutinizes and judges affairs incorrectly; Life changes people, and people fall out of love. Its no ones fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; A lot of people are not in love with their spouse anymore, but dont know what &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Divorce is unnecessarily adversarial and confusing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I was disrupting the lives of my children and choosing to leave anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I had a good marriage. I needed to figure out what happened to not repeat the cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I wanted to heal fully; not live in anger.&lt;/p&gt;" />
