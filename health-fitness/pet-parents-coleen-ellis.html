  <title>Pet Parents - Coleen Ellis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Coleen Ellis&lt;/b&gt; lost her baby girl in 2003, and she was devastated. No one understood how she could be so upset over losing just a dog, and she could never really say goodbye to her terrier-schnauzer mix, Mico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help pet parents everywhere, she opened the first standalone pet funeral home in the United States in Indianapolis. In this guidebook, she helps pet parents, veterinarians, death-care professionals and others celebrate the special bonds we share with our animal companions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing upon her experiences helping thousands of pet parents and pet care professionals, Ellis provides:&lt;/p&gt;
 ideas to help celebrate the special bonds people share with their pets;   
  checklists to choose the right cremation provider or funeral home;   
  heartwarming stories that show how pets can be honored in life and in death;   
  information on how death-care professionals, veterinarians and others are taking steps to serve pet parents;   
  additional resources to help people remember their pets the way they want.   
&lt;p&gt;People everywhere want to honor the lives of their pets, and even if you arent a pet owner, you need to understand why this is important. Help yourself and those you care about with Pet Parents: A Journey Through Unconditional Love and Grief. &lt;/p&gt;" />
