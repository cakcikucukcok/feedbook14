  <title>The Endurance Diet - Matt Fitzgerald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Sports Nutritionist Matt Fitzgerald has spent nearly twenty years studying the diets of top professional endurance athletes, who are among the fittest and healthiest people in the world. As a result, he has identified five core habits-most of which are contrary to what popular diets advise-that are essential to maximizing workout benefits. &lt;i&gt;The Endurance Diet&lt;/i&gt; shares key strategies for optimal health and performance: eat everything, eat quality, eat carbohydrate, eat enough, and eat individually. Whether you want to lose weight, win a race, or look a little more like an elite athlete, this plan is for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;I am always amazed at how much I learn from Matt Fitzgerald&#39;s books.&quot;&lt;br&gt;-Shalane Flanagan, Olympic bronze medalist&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
