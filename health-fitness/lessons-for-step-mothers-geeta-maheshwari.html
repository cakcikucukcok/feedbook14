  <title>Lessons for Step Mothers - Geeta Maheshwari</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ever since Cinderella, the word wicked seems to have got permanently prefixed to step mothers which is not only unfair, it is also not true. Most women consider step motherhood as their lifes highest calling. They go above and beyond the call of duty to make their step children feel loved and welcomed and all they get is attitudes, eye rolls, and sarcastic remarks. They cant even share their pain with anyone because if they do, the only thing they get to hear every time is, well you knew there were kids involved.
Every step mother-to-be knows there are kids involved. Of course she does. She has just no idea how demanding and difficult her job is going to be. With duties and responsibilities sans the rights and the glory, caring for someone elses children can be very demoralizing. Plus with the wicked step mother myth chasing her like a shadow 24x7, it is difficult for her to just be. No wonder most step mothers consider their journey the hardest road travelled.
What a step mother needs to realize is that she can neither change societys perception of her nor can she win her step children over by becoming a doormat in her own home. Instead she should invest her time and energy to learn about her step family and her role therein. Thats where this book will come in handy. It has some very useful lessons that will guide every woman who is either contemplating step motherhood or is already there and struggling to:
	Comprehend the intricate dynamics of step
	Know why she is a soft target
	Debunk step family myths
	Bond with her step kids
	Keep her identity
	Prevent step maternal burnout
	Protect her sanity" />
