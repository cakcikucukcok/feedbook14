  <title>A Strategy for Success - Marianne Harms</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If you never have thought about creating a plan for your life, or met with failure and frustration when you did, then this will be the most important book you have ever read.  If you have dreamed or wished you were wealthier or happier, could find love or inner peace, or a healthy life style but didnt know how to get it then read on....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words that follow in this book will provide you with an understanding of the psychodynamics of human interactions so that you have the tools and skills to move forward in life with high self-esteem and to create an achievable plan for accomplishing your lifes goals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your attitudes, visualizations, affirmations and beliefs play a large part in creating a high self-esteem level, (otherwise called your SEL.) Without bringing consciousness to these aspects of your inner world your plan of action will lead to frustration and failure as you unconsciously sabotage your best efforts.  By changing your mind from negative to positive beliefs, creating a strategy and following your plan, you can manifest the changes you wish to create in your life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BEING CLEAR ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT, SETTING DOWN THESE OBJECTIVES, MAPPING YOUR INTENTIONS, VISUALIZING THEM BY FOCUSING ON THE DESIRED OUTCOME AND TAKING ACTION CAN MAKE YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE.  Goal setting is essential during all stages of life and it is never too late to start. The earlier in life one learns to appreciate the value of goal setting the better, but you are never too young or too old to reap the rewards of reaching objectives.  Happiness, contentment and success are features of living that everyone seeks and deserves regardless of age. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it&#39;s up to you to use the tools and strategies in this book to create the life you have dreamed of having. &lt;/p&gt;" />
