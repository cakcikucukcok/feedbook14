  <title>New Life Hiking Spa®’S 40 Years of Authentic Wellness - Jimmy LeSage M.S.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the Green Mountains of Central Vermont is the New Life Hiking Spa, owned and operated by Jimmy LeSage for forty consecutive years. New Life is a program that helps guests awaken themselves to the power of nutrition and fitness. New Life is Jimmys forum for including guests on his four-decade journey to authentic wellness. Jimmy shares that journeys wisdom by assisting guests to translate their New Life experience into their own lifestyle upon return home. Jimmys own journey and the impressive body-spirit changes in New Life guests give Jimmy much of relevance to impart about our prospects for well-being as we consider our lifestyle and relationship with food.
Health, fitness, wellness, and quality of life have become such big news that any reasonable understanding is not only confusing. It is downright difficult. At New Life, and now in this presentation, Jimmy travels with you to assure that you will differentiate meaningfully between passing fads and noteworthy trends in wellness.
Jimmys journey merits your attention because it, like the well-being it speaks of, is very personal and authentic. We may find that New Life is so personal for Jimmy that it came to pass as much for himself as for all who have or ever will come. New Life has become a laboratory that has endowed Jimmy with a commitment to the healing power of good food and a bit of activity. 
Jimmy has transformed New Life into an incubator for practical steps out of the confusion and complication in the bottom-line requirement for existence: food. Jimmy earns your attention because the journey on which he invites you has prepared him thoroughly to inspire you to initiate changes in your own food behaviors." />
