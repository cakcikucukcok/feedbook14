  <title>A Survival Guide for Athletes and Parents - Leandrea Slayton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever sat in the stands or sidelines and listened to parents yell at their kids and thought, &quot;There is something wrong here?&quot; Does your child show passion and potential in a sport but feels an unhealthy amount of pressure that is leading them to want to quit the sport they used to love so much?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The reality is, the approach society is taking to competitive youth sports as a whole is unhealthy, but it doesn&#39;t have to be that way. I am not an advocate for everybody wins; I love competition. I believe that with the correct perspective and approach youth athletics can be used to mold our children into Christ-like, confident, and joyful adults. By focusing on the journey rather than the destination players and parents can learn to find value in all of the life lessons that come through competition.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This book is a guide that is inspired through twenty-four years of coaching and watching parents who got it right and the others who missed out on the opportunity to use youth athletics to instill Christ-like characteristics and perspectives in their children. The true prize in athletics isn&#39;t a trophy or even a scholarship, it is in the life lessons that everyone has available to learn if they are willing to look for them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
