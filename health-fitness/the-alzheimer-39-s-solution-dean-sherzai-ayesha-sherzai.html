  <title>The Alzheimer&#39;s Solution - Dean Sherzai, Ayesha Sherzai</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A revolutionary, proven program for reversing the symptoms of Alzheimer&#39;s disease and cognitive decline from award winning neurologists and codirectors of the Brain Health and Alzheimer&#39;s Prevention Program at Loma Linda University Medical Center&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 47 million people are currently living with Alzheimer&amp;#8217;s disease worldwide. While all other major diseases are in decline, deaths from Alzheimer&amp;#8217;s have increased radically. What you or your loved ones don&amp;#8217;t yet know is that 90 percent of Alzheimer&amp;#8217;s cases can be prevented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the largest clinical and observational study to date, neurologists and codirectors of the Brain Health and Alzheimer&amp;#8217;s Prevention Program at Loma Linda University Medical Center, Drs. Dean and Ayesha Sherzai, offer in &lt;em&gt;The Alzheimer&amp;#8217;s Solution &lt;/em&gt;the first comprehensive program for preventing Alzheimer&amp;#8217;s disease and improving cognitive function. Alzheimer&amp;#8217;s disease isn&amp;#8217;t a genetic inevitability, and a diagnosis does not need to come with a death sentence. Ninety percent of grandparents, parents, husbands, and wives can be spared. Ninety percent of us can avoid ever getting Alzheimer&amp;#8217;s, and for the 10 percent with strong genetic risk for cognitive decline, the disease can be delayed by ten to fifteen years. This isn&amp;#8217;t an estimate or wishful thinking; it&amp;#8217;s a percentage based on rigorous science and the remarkable results the Sherzais have seen firsthand in their clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This much-needed revolutionary book reveals how the brain is a living universe, directly influenced by nutrition, exercise, stress, sleep, and engagement. In other words: what you feed it, how you treat it, when you challenge it, and the ways in which you allow it to rest. These factors are the pillars of the groundbreaking program you&amp;#8217;ll find in these pages, which features a personalized assessment for evaluating risk, a five-part program for prevention and symptom-reversal, and day-by-day guides for optimizing cognitive function. You can prevent Alzheimer&amp;#8217;s disease from affecting you, your family, friends, and loved ones. Even with a diagnosis, you can reverse cognitive decline and add vibrant years to your life. The future of your brain is finally within your control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
