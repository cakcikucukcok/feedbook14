  <title>Dear Photograph - Taylor Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We all have moments we wish we could relive. We&#39;d give anything to skid down the toboggan hills of our youth, to breathe in the smell of our children as babies, or to spend just one more minute with someone we&#39;ve lost. &lt;em&gt;Dear Photograph&lt;/em&gt; provides a way to link these memories from the past to the present, overlapping them to see how the daydreams of our memories collide with our current realities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is simple: hold up a photograph from the past in front of the place where it was originally taken, take a second photograph, and add a sentence of dedication about what the photograph means to you. The results, however, are astounding, which is why millions have flocked to dearphotograph.com and thousands have submitted their own Dear Photographs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This stunning visual compilation includes more than 140 never-before-seen Dear Photographs, as well as a space for you to attach your own cherished photo. By turns nostalgic, charming, and poignant, &lt;em&gt;Dear Photograph&lt;/em&gt; evokes childhood memories, laments difficult losses, and, above all, celebrates the universal nature of love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
