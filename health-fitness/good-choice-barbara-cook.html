  <title>Good Choice - Barbara Cook</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;So a soul goes into a waiting room  It sounds like the beginning of a joke, doesnt it?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;No, its not a joke, but time for the big adventure. The soul is ready to start life anew. Assisted by consultants Lee and Jo, the soul ponders the many aspects of the physical world, eventually finding the exact placement needed to evolve in this lifetime. Later the four-and-a-half year-old child finds her way into the magical corner shop, where kindly old Mrs. Mills helps her to choose the protective behaviours that will see her safely through childhood.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Good Choice&lt;/i&gt;, author Barbara Cook presents a fictional representation of &lt;i&gt;A Souls Story&lt;/i&gt;, based on her personal experiences. Depicted through two of the magical and heart-warming consultations at pivotal moments on this souls journey, it offers a view of how ones existence evolves.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;This book develops the consciousness of the soul by uncovering what it has always known, and allowing it to take in the divine essence of its earthly experiences. It is for anyone who wants to be healed from the inside out, to find peace in their heart, to be fulfilled and free.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;B&gt;Maree&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;Its like you are in my head on this journey with me. To see it in words, and to know that you have been here and made it through gives me hope and strength. To know that this is how we feel turns pain into privilege.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;B&gt;Stacey&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
