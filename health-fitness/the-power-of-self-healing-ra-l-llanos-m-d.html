  <title>The Power of Self Healing - Raúl Llanos M.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We are all interested in knowing who we are and the purpose of 
our lives. Our healing gives us the opportunity to understand 
ourselves better and therefore achieve better health. When we take 
more responsibility for our healing, we can expand more our levels of 
knowledge and welfare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the journey you will take upon reading my book, you will 
fi nd the opportunity to share with me my sincere wishes to fi nd a better 
welfare for ourselves, as human beings, and the universe in general.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I was born in Surata, Colombia. I fi nished my medical studies at 
the medical school of the Universidad del Valle and University 
Hospital in Cali, Colombia; the Lutheran Medical Center in 
Cleveland; and the Charity Hospital of New Orleans, Tulane 
Division, where I did my specialization in obstetrics and 
gynecology.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Through my human experience, I have been in different places 
and at different times, but in the deepest core of my being, there has always 
been a need for a better relationship with myself and with my outer world.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I have always wanted to vividly live more consciously, my knowledge and my 
experience of holistic medicine as integral as a hologram. My relationship 
with nature, my sports, among others, and the need to live in a family that is 
increasingly healthier physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually as well 
have been the key drivers of my enigmas and dilemmas in finding my self healing. 
Let us create more hope.&lt;/p&gt;" />
