  <title>The Pleasure of Their Company: An Owner&#39;s Guide to Parrot Training - Bonnie Munro Doane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Making the Most of a Good Thing Sharing Your Home and Life with a pet bird from the parrot family can be a joy that must be experienced to be appreciated. Whether your parrot pal is a lordly macaw, a tiny budgie or any of the beautiful Amazons, African greys, cockatoos or other beloved species in between, life can be beautiful when communication works. And that is what The Pleasure of Their Company: An Owner&#39;s Guide to Parrot Training can do for the relationship.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The text discusses the reasons for training a parrot, how an owner&#39;s behavior influences training results, working with baby birds and weanlings, three basic obedience skills and training techniques for adult parrots. You will find chapters on potty training to help your parrot clean up its act; speech training that makes your parrot more fun to be with and some intriguing examples of parrots really knowing what they&#39;re saying; trick training that allows a parrot to use its nimble mind and dexterous body together and some valuable insights on fun and games with your parrot to enjoy your relationship fully. With delightful illustrations by parrot lover Richard Cole and a wealth of practical guidance, The Pleasure of Their Company is the gift you give yourself and your parrot to make life better for you both." />
