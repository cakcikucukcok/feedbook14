In no time your dog will not only bring in the paper, play  dead and roll over but also count objects, jump into your arms, crawl  like a soldier and take a bow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babette was voted &quot;Palm Beach&#39;s  Favorite Dog Trainer.&quot; She has been featured on television and radio,  including Animal Planet, Martha Stewart&#39;s &quot;Living Radio&quot; and most  recently, the E! reality series, &lt;i&gt;Married to Jonas&lt;/i&gt;.
