  <title>I See . . . - Kat J Phillips, Emily Hulsey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;I see... what others refuse to see...&quot; That is the first line of a poem that brought about hundreds of ideas, other poems and opened our minds and hearts to the gift we have to share; the ability to move people with our words. However, this book does not stop there. The photos are not always an exact match to the poem, but instead enhance the reading and give depth and a possible different perspective to each piece of writing. Look at the picture, then read the poem and look at the picture again. You may want to reread the poem; possibly to find something new. The journey you may embark on is one of depth and self-reflection. Generally speaking, poetry makes one think and photography allows one to see. We want the opposite to happen. We want our photos to bring about thoughts that are new to our readers and the poems to help them see the world anew. Author and poet, William Blake wrote (c.1803), To see the world in a grain of sand, and a heaven in a wild flower. Look through the grainy wild flowers and find your own world within these poems. Think about what the photographs have to say and what hidden meanings are waiting to be discovered." />
