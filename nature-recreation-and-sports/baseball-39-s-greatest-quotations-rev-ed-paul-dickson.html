  <title>Baseball&#39;s Greatest Quotations Rev. Ed. - Paul Dickson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Baseball has always had its share of colorful characters, and over the years they have expressed themselves in eminently quotable ways. In this treasury of more than 5,000 quotations, noted baseball writer and observer Paul Dickson has captured the flavor of the game, in the words of its most important participants and onlookers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are all here&amp;#8212;from Aaron (Estella, Hank&amp;#39;s mother) to Zoldack (&amp;#34;Sad Sack&amp;#34; Sam), and everyone in between. From the players, sportswriters, and politicians, to noted personalities in other fields (a very diverse group), everyone has his or her say on our nation&amp;#39;s pastime. Dickson skillfully selects and annotates each remark, presenting the good, the bad, and the ugly of baseball lore. Included are extended lessons in Stengelese, Reggiespeak, Earl Weaverisms, and famous announcers&amp;#39; home run calls (who can forget Mel Allen&amp;#39;s classic &amp;#34;Going, going, gone!&amp;#34;?).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These and thousands of other cheerful, pithy, and memorable voices from the past through the present day are all captured in &lt;em&gt;Baseball&amp;#39;s Greatest Quotations&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
