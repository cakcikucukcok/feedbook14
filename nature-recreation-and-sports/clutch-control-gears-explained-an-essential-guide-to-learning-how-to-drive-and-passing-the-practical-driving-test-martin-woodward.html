  <title>Clutch Control &amp; Gears Explained - An Essential Guide to Learning How to Drive and Passing the Practical Driving Test - Martin Woodward</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The majority of driving instruction books deal mainly with Road Procedure and only touch briefly on Control. Admittedly in order to master the control you must have in car tuition / practice, but with the correct understanding, this can be achieved much more quickly. This short book deals only with control (mainly clutch control and gears) and aims to give the reader a thorough understanding of this. Having gained the necessary controlling ability, you can then focus your attention on the never ending Road Procedure. Also be aware that Road Procedure may vary throughout the world according to local laws, but Control is the same worldwide - and as such this guide is applicable worldwide. This may be of particular interest to individuals in the USA who want to learn how to use a clutch and stick shift for a manual transmission vehicle." />
