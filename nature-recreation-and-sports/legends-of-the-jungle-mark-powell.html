  <title>Legends of the Jungle - Mark Powell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Boomer Esiason still holds the Cincinnati Bengals record for most passing yards in a game and is tied for the most 300-yard passing games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim Breech is the teams all-time leading scorer in points and remains a beloved figure more than twenty years after his retirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cris Collinsworth led the team in receptions and receiving yards several times in the 1980sand topped the team in receiving touchdowns three times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these great players and many others arent in the Bengals Hall of Fame, and its for a simple reason: It does not exist. That needs to change, according to die-hard fan Mark Powell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By creating its own Hall of Fame or Ring of Honor, the team would be paying tribute to its great players and personalities. But it would need to determine who is eligible and who should be honored first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get a detailed look at one of the NFLs most interesting franchises, discover its rich history, and decide for yourself who deserves to be among the Legends of the Jungle.&lt;/p&gt;" />
