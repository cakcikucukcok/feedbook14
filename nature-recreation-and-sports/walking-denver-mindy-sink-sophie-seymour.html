  <title>Walking Denver - Mindy Sink, Sophie Seymour</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;People come to Denver for the nearby mountains and spectacular natural beauty, the craft beer, the outdoor lifestyle and mild climate with abundant sunshine, but what they also discover is how walkable it is as they explore culinary treasures, history that goes from the time of the dinosaurs to the founding of the Centennial state, and unique culture of the west. &lt;/p&gt;
In &lt;i&gt;Walking Denver&lt;/i&gt;, author and local &lt;b&gt;Mindy Sink&lt;/b&gt; guides readers—whether they are first-time visitors or natives—on 32 diverse walks through the heart of the city, up into the foothills of the Rocky Mountains and across the eastern plains. Find the spots where the city reaches 5,280 feet above sea level or one mile high, giving the city it’s nickname of the Mile High City; tiptoe through historic cemeteries and learn of those who shaped Denver in its early days; explore the arts in the Golden Triangle and Arts District on Santa Fe neighborhoods; plan for a half-day outing to the famed Red Rocks Park and Amphitheatre and nearby Lookout Mountain Nature Center &amp; Preserve; visit the state’s first capitol with a stroll through downtown Golden and much more. &lt;/p&gt;
In this new edition, the author invited her then-11 year old daughter, Sophie Seymour, to contribute “Kid Tips” to select walks that are most suitable for families. Sophie highlights the elements of these walks that will most appeal to kids—playgrounds, wildlife, and activities along the way. Not only is the whole family getting some exercise, they are learning together about history, art, architectural trivia, and what makes this place so engaging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re looking for a two-hour stroll or a full-day’s entertainment, grab this book, step outside…walk Denver!  &lt;/p&gt;" />
