  <title>Terrier Memoirs - T.J. Hartford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Terrier Memoirs paints a mosaic that these players, cheerleaders, coaches, trainers, and friends of football were universally affected by the presence of and participation in Boston University Football. They came from all walks of life, were unified as a team toward common and lofty goals, and emerged as educated men prepared to begin their professional lives not just with lessons from the classroom but those on the field of competition. Their stories are personal, comic, heartbreaking, and poignant. They speak of accomplishments where it could be argued that were it not for football and the opportunity it provided in obtaining an education, their professional accomplishments may never have come to pass. Their stories are proof that football indeed has a value on college campuses and should be considered an investment, not just a cost." />
