  <title>The United States Pony Club Manual of Horsemanship: Basics for Beginners / D Level - Susan E. Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Required reading for every Pony Club Member-now in a valuable new edition&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States Pony Club (USPC) is among the largest equestrian organizations in the United States, with more than 14,000 members in 600 clubs spread across 49 states, credited with training many current and past Olympic competitors. The USPC Manuals are required reading for every Pony Club Member, and will continue to be required reading into their new editions. &lt;p&gt;This book is written and illustrated for youngsters who want to learn to ride, especially members of the U.S. Pony Clubs, Inc., who want to meet the USPC&#39;s Standards of Proficiency. If you&#39;re that youngster, you will be able to read this book on your own. This classic guide will show you how to become a careful, thoughtful rider and how to communicate with and understand your pony. Some sections, however, are meant to be read by an adult (a parent or riding instructor), so you can get the extra help you may need to reach your goals. By the time you have read this book you will know a lot about riding in a ring and in the open; beginning jumping; pony care and handling; safety; having fun and meeting challenges; and much more. &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;New information on critical developments in riding, instruction, and competition&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The latest research and development in nutrition and veterinary topics&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coverage of land conservation and horse health and safety&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All-new photos and a fully updated look and feel&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re a beginning rider, parent, or instructor, &lt;i&gt;The United States Pony Club Manual of Horsemanship&lt;/i&gt; is a solid source of instruction, regardless of whether or not a Pony Club chapter is within reach." />
