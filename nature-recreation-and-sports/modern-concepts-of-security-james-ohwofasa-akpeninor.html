  <title>Modern Concepts of Security - James Ohwofasa Akpeninor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="AKPENINOR James Ohwofasa is an accomplished multi-disciplinary Author who has authored several Books and Articles across the the fields of Political science, Criminology &amp; Security studies, Environmental science and Theology.
I have been associated with the security operations at various levels of jurisdictions from the National security policing (covert operations) to the Industrial/Commercial security setup; to Corporations proprietary security practice and supervision over the past three and a half decades. In this stretch, I have become conscious of the vital necessity for comprehensive documentation of security and safety archetypes for the study of this unique profession in which reference materials for developing core and universal curricula for training or self improvement of security operatives are hard to come by. Most often, law enforcement agents or persons charged with security managements - Security Directors, Fire Safety Directors, the police and even Contract Security firms have hardly come to terms with the Herculean professional demands of this specialized professional calling which has conspicuously assumed the centre stage of global awareness of the present-day.
It is with these concerns that this book is designed to be a working companion to personnel and agencies in the security professional trade  the Armed forces personnel together with other national security agents (DSS, DIA, NIA, NDLEA, etc.); the Para-military (Police, ICPC, EFCC, Customs &amp; Excise Immigrations departments, FRSC, NCDC and a host of others).
Emphatically, modern security outlook incorporates the Human Security schools of thought which is all about the practice of international security that is a shift from the traditional conception of national security (a state-centred approach) to focus on the individual, which is yet to be cultivated in the African continent resulting in enduring problems of disease, poverty, security adversities, violence, human rights abuses and civil strives. This professional security guidebook is hence meant to offer sound basic knowledge for security practitioners, contract security firms as well as for individual reading to boost security consciousness of the entire public." />
