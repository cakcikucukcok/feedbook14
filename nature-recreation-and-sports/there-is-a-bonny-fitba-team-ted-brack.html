  <title>There is a Bonny Fitba Team - Ted Brack</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Over the last fifty years, Ted Brack has supported Hibernian FC through good times and bad. Between watching Hibs lose the Scottish Cup Final to Clyde in 1958 and celebrating their CIS Cup triumph nearly fifty years later there have been famous victories over Barcelona and Real Madrid and, of course, the unforgettable 7-0 triumph over Hearts on New Year&#39;s Day in 1973. There Is A Bonny Fitba Team now tells the remarkable story of Ted&#39;s five decades on the Hibee highway, supporting the club he loves. It&#39;s an affectionate and honest account of the dramas, delights and disappointments of being a Hibs fan, recalling great matches and players with pride and passion but pulling no punches along the way when things have gone wrong. It&#39;s a compelling account and a must-read book for all fans of football and Hibernian FC. &#39;A true Hibernian delight. Ted has captured the essence of our great club absolutely perfectly.&#39; Tom O&#39;Malley, former Chairman Hibernian FC &#39;Like me, Ted Brack has supported Hibs all his life. He has now written a first-class book on the highs and lows of being a Hibee. I commend Ted&#39;s story to all football fans.&#39; Keith Wright, Hibernian FC and Scotland &#39;As someone who has been associated with Hibernian Football Club for sixty years, I really enjoyed Ted Brack&#39;s colourful chronicle of players and events. The Hibee Highway is a road well worth travelling.&#39; Lawrie Reilly, Hibernian FC and Scotland and a member of the legendary Famous Five" />
