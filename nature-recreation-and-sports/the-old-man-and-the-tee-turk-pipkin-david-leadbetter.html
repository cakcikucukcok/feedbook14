  <title>The Old Man and the Tee - Turk Pipkin, David Leadbetter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As a kid caddying for his father on the sunburned links of West Texas, Turk Pipkin had dreamed of great achievements in golf. Unfortunately, life got in the way. A lack of talent didn&#39;t help much either. It was not until his father passed away that Turk realized he&#39;d forgotten his childhood dream and had lost the simple joy he&#39;d once found in the game.&lt;br&gt;Deciding that the time for all his pitiful golf excuses was past, Turk embarked upon the golf quest of a lifetime. For twelve months, he&#39;d ignore work and other distractions, and dedicate himself to the game. He&#39;d seek instruction from golf&#39;s greatest teachers, put the best equipment in his bag, and play the world&#39;s finest courses. His seemingly impossible goal was to take ten strokes off his 16-handicap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With lessons from David Leadbetter, Dave Pelz, and Ben Crenshaw, and with spiritual guidance from great old men like Willie Nelson, George Plimpton, and Byron Nelson, Turk&#39;s epic journey carries him from Pebble Beach to Scotland and back again, where he risks everything on one final round for his father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Old Man and the Tee&lt;/i&gt;, follow Turk on the journey of a lifetime, and learn to love golf-and life- all over again.&lt;/p&gt;" />
