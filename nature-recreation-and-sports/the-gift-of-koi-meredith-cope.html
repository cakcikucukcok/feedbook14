  <title>The Gift of Koi - Meredith Cope</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Embark on an underwater journey filled with light and love. Through paintings, poetry, and prose, you will share in the insights and heartfelt beauty of Meredith Copes visiontender reflections on the power of what nature and art bring to our lives. As is typical of life, the artists personal story of her quest to understand color revealed so much more. We often think we are about one thing, only to find that life leads us to places of its own design. Join in her journey that connected her to her purposeto share the gift of koi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primal elements of water, early life, light, and reflections call forth deep meaning and messages of hope and connectionsustaining insights for us all. The oil paintings of Hawaiian koi by the artist seem lit from within by that message. Powerfully present, the koi flow in sparkling images across the canvas and across the page, beckoning us to go deeper into our own journey of understanding and potential within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meredith Copes work has been acclaimed as one that defies classification. It is classical in form while exhibiting a unique departure inclusive of a wide range of workincluding dreamlike aspects of surrealism, impressionistic color and light effects, with the raw immediacy of expressionism. Paradoxically, it possesses a firm grip on reality while transporting the viewer into the artists own personal suspension of space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Japanese legend, if a koi succeeded in climbing the falls at a point called Dragon Gate on the Yellow River, it would be transformed into a dragon. I think Meredith has already succeeded in the art scene; she has reached perfection and her works are very inspiring. If you look closely, you can see the water moving  Congrats and keep showing your good work.&lt;/p&gt;
