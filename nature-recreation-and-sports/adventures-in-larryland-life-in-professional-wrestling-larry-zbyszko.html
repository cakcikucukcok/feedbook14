Voted Rookie of the Year in 1974, Larry&amp;#160;Zbyszko enjoyed 30 glorious years as a top draw in the wild and wacky world of professional wrestling. Attendance records were shattered when he wrestled the original &amp;#147;Living Legend,&amp;#8221; Bruno Sammartino, in 1980 and won by hitting his former mentor with a chair&amp;#151;a rarity at the time. Chronicling Zbysko&#39;s transformation from baby-faced hero to one of the most hated wrestlers of his time, this uninhibited narrative reveals an insider&#39;s view of some of the most successful and controversial stories and scandals in pro-wrestling history.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
