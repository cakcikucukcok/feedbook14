  <title>Getting Back or into Ink Pen Drawing Two - Jeffrey Otterson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book, Getting Back or Into Ink Pen Drawing Two is a continuation from my first Ink Pen Drawing book. Though it isnt exactly in certain terms, it is a little difficult so Im not going to define. I did use a fair amount of abstract subject and related too realistic to show some drawing ideas and techniques to make or form a picture. For some the subject wasnt of importance, the technique and colors used were. The working order of the applying and presenting on paper visual ideas. Color relationships even though I kept them simple, a intent of mine, due in part to me just re-establishing with ink drawing. And I am putting a color relation repertoire together to have a foundation to work from for future Art pictures. Youll notice I went from one thing to another, so in more a other less for some degree. This book has different reasons and many arent that explained in writing while some are. I made sure there is decent reason for the pictures I drew and for them to be at or near certain subject for technique and color, though some werent from intention. I couldnt have put this book together without my first book, even if I didnt exactly peer it down for ideas, etc. In art I think things or items are led to another from subject parts of the past that are on paper, etc - by a same kind person. So I dont waste time with much of non useful interest. - They usually have some items for a new project sometime in the future. Usually I try to keep them close unless I deviate too far into something, these I set aside for another time if it is still an interest." />
