  <title>Restoring the Flow - Robert William Sandford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Try as we might, parts of North America may not escape the impacts of the global water crisis. The same kinds of water supply and quality issues that have appeared around our crowded planet are already beginning to present themselves here. Unfortunately, this is occurring at a time when, as a direct result of declining global food production, the world is beginning to rely more heavily than ever on agricultural communities in North America to help meet increasingly unattainable food-production goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of waiting for a water crisis of our own, North Americans may well wish to put the lessons learned elsewhere in the world into active practice. Passionately conceived, clearly written and citing concrete examples from all over the world, &lt;i&gt;Restoring the Flow&lt;/i&gt; is an approachable yet authoritative source, one of the many implements concerned citizens, government officials, businesspeople and policymakers can use and reuse in understanding and addressing this ever-growing global crisis.&lt;/p&gt;" />
