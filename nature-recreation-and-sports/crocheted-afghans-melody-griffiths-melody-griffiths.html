  <title>Crocheted Afghans - Melody Griffiths, Melody Griffiths</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fill your home with splashes of color with any of these 25 beautiful throws and wraps. Whether you want to make a lovely quilt to pass down from generation to generation or a fireside blanket for winter nights, you will be sure to find a project to cherish as you transform your yarn into a wonderful range of fabrics. The designs for this stunning collection of crocheted afghans, comforters, blankets, and more are inspired by a whole range of sources. You can get an heirloom effect with wraps and throws based on antique lace and traditional textiles or, if your dream is of pioneer patchwork, try one of the patterns influenced by everything American—from Navajo motifs to crazy quilt patchwork. All the information you need is here, provided in a way that is so simple to understand, with charts and detailed instructions for 25 projects, plus 10 extra ideas for ways of using the same instructions to make larger or smaller items, such as bed covers or pillows. And don&#39;t be afraid of the professional, luscious look of the blankets you see in the photos—the designs have been created with simplicity in mind, so even novice crocheters will produce exquisite pieces in no time at all. Many of the projects are made up of small, easy-to-work-with squares and motifs, so you can carry on crafting while on the move." />
