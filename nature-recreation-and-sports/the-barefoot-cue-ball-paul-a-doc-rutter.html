  <title>The Barefoot Cue Ball - Paul A. “Doc” Rutter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is written for the aficionados of pocket billiards, the weekly recreational &amp; league players, the Pro-players, the action players, and even the actor players, playing players in movies or TV shows. We must also include the backbone of pocket and carom billiards. A most unlikely group of people that play pool so casually that they dont even consider themselves as players. It is just something to do while waiting for something else to happen. 
These billiard characters reside in the mysterious back corners of my mind. Over the last few years they kept driving me, at odd hours to, go ahead Doc, write it down, dont let our billiard knowledge just die out and fritter away. 
I listened. To list all these players, writers, supporters and industry suppliers that influenced me is not practical, but they were all subconsciously urging me on. Some were mere shadows of memories or ghosts flickering through the murky mental back roads. All had a part in this. God bless them all for those parts that they played." />
