  <title>Ice with Everything - H.W. Tilman, Trevor Robertson, Alex Ramsay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘For most men, as Epicurus has remarked, rest is stagnation and activity madness. Mad or not, the activity that I have been pursuing for the last twenty years takes the form of voyages to remote, mountainous regions.’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;H.W. ‘Bill’ Tilman&lt;/b&gt;’s fourteenth book describes three more of those voyages, &lt;i&gt;‘the first comparatively humdrum, the second totally disastrous, and the third exceedingly troublesome’&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first voyage describes Tilman’s 1971 attempt to reach East Greenland’s remote and ice-bound &lt;b&gt;Scoresby Sound&lt;/b&gt;. The largest fjord system in the world was named after the father of Whitby whaling captain, &lt;b&gt;William Scoresby&lt;/b&gt;, who first charted the coastline in 1822. Scoresby’s two-volume Account of the Arctic Regions provided much of the historical inspiration for Tilman’s northern voyages and fuelled his fascination with Scoresby Sound and the unclimbed mountains at its head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tilman’s first attempt to reach the fjord had already cost him his first boat, &lt;i&gt;Mischief&lt;/i&gt;, in 1968. The following year, a &lt;i&gt;‘polite mutiny’&lt;/i&gt; aboard &lt;i&gt;Sea Breeze&lt;/i&gt; had forced him to turn back within sight of the entrance, so with a good crew aboard in 1971, it was particularly frustrating for Tilman to find the fjord blocked once more, this time by impenetrable sea ice at the entrance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refusing to give up, Tilman’s obsession with Scoresby Sound continued in 1972 when a series of unfortunate events led to the loss of &lt;i&gt;Sea Breeze&lt;/i&gt;, crushed between a rock and an ice floe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safely back home in Wales, the inevitable search for a new boat began. ‘&lt;i&gt;One cannot buy a biggish boat as if buying a piece of soap. The act is almost as irrevocable as marriage and should be given as much thought.&lt;/i&gt;’ The 1902 pilot cutter &lt;i&gt;Baroque&lt;/i&gt;, was acquired and after not inconsiderable expense, proved equal to the challenge. Tilman’s first troublesome voyage aboard her to West Greenland in 1973 completes this collection.&lt;/p&gt;" />
