  <title>The Peace in Peril: The Real Cost of the Site C Dam - Christopher Pollon, Ben Nelms</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;In the next decade, a 60-metre-high wall of compacted earth will stretch more than a kilometre across the main stem of the Peace River, causing the waters behind it to swell into a 93-square-kilometre artificial lake, drowning the best topsoil left in the BC north. The waters will swallow fifty islands and a valley that is home to farmers, ranchers, trappers and habitat to innumerable creatures big and small.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Over four days in late September 2015, Christopher Pollon paddled the 83-kilometre section of the river that will be destroyed by the Site C dam reservoir, accompanied by photojournalist Ben Nelms. Their goal was to witness the very first steps of construction for the almost $8.8-billion project (the most expensive infrastructure project in BC history). They concluded their trip by touring the same stretch by land, interviewing and photographing the locals who stand to lose everything.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Equal parts travel adventure, history and journalistic exploration, &lt;I&gt;The Peace in Peril&lt;/I&gt; is a story about the dubious trade-off of hydro power for resources like timber and farmland, but also far more: the Peace valley has been a prosperous home to people for eleven thousand years. How will lives, human and otherwise, be erased or irrevocably altered when the next great flood rises up to engulf the Peace River valley?&lt;/div&gt;" />
