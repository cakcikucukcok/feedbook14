      <meta name="description" content="This book for young readers shares how Andrew J, a dog who discovers a second chance at happiness after he&#39;s rescued from neglect, helps a brain aneurysm survivor thrive.  &quot;Andy was an incredible empathetic dog, he was a people&#39;s pleaser. I could see that even when he was very sick, he just wanted to be close to his owner and be there for her.&quot; -Dr. Don Ernat, Associate Veterinarian  at Lombard Veterinarian Hospital.   &quot;Dog owners often think of themselves as being their dogs&#39; caretakers, but caring for our dogs often inspires us to take better care of ourselves, particularly in times of crisis. Dogs also inspire by &quot;personifying&quot; resilience, living in the moment, and taking life one day at a time. We are fortunate dogs take such good care of us.&quot;  -Callandre A.
