  <title>Origami Architecture: Create Lifelike Scale Paper Models of Three Iconic Buildings [Downloadable Folding Paper] - (Artist) Yee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;Build detailed models of your favorite iconic buildings with this easy origami ebook!&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Master paper crafter and preeminent designer Yee, brings origami folders this extraordinary boxed architectural craft ebook which brings some of the worlds&#39; most recognized architectural feats to life.  Yee started folding paper as a child in Hong Kong.  He didn&#39;t have any toys and so learned to make his own from old newspapers.  This origami ebook allows you, the paper folder to make some of his best works.  Once assembled, the paper models can be displayed in 3D form on a table or shelf or they can be folded flat for easy storage and carried in a bag or briefcase to show your friends.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;This origami ebook contains:&lt;/B&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Detailed step-by-step origami book&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Over 150 full-color photos&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; 20 sheets of high-quality, pre-cut card stock&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Since there is no complicated cutting or painting required, the origami models are simple enough to be considered origami-for-kids projects and are a great way for those with no previous paper folding experience to learn origami. &lt;I&gt;Origami Architecture&lt;/I&gt; contains downloadable folding papers which gives you all the materials to get you started with assembling the scale models. The facade designs are based on the real architecture of the buildings.  The decorative details are colored black to reduce the cutting work, but for those origami enthusiasts who love to cut, the black colored details can be removed, making the paper structures even more stunning.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Origami projects include:&lt;/B&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; The Eiffel Tower&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The White House&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The Sydney Opera House&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
