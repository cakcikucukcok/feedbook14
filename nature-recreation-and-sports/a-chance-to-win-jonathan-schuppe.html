  <title>A Chance to Win - Jonathan Schuppe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist follows an embattled Little League team in inner-city Newark, New Jersey, revealing the complex realities of urban life in one of America&#39;s most dangerous cities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Rodney Mason, an ex-con drug dealer from Newark&#39;s rough South Ward, was shot and paralyzed, he vowed to turn his life around. A former high-school pitching ace with a 93 mph fastball, Mason decided to form a Little League team to help boys avoid the street life that had claimed his youth and mobility. Predictably, the players struggle--they endure poverty, unstable family lives with few positive male role models, failing schools, and dangerous neighborhoods--but through the fists and tears, lopsided losses and rare victories, this bunch of misfits becomes a team, and in doing so gives the community something to root for. With in-depth reporting, fascinating characters, and vivid prose, Jonathan Schuppe&#39;s &lt;i&gt;A Chance to Win&lt;/i&gt; is both a penetrating, true-to-life portrait of what&#39;s at stake for kids growing up poor in America&#39;s inner cities and a portrait of Newark itself, a struggling city that has recently known great hope as well as failure.&lt;/p&gt;" />
