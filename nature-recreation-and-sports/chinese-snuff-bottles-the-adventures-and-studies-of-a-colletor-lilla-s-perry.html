      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;Chinese Snuff Bottles&lt;/I&gt; is invaluable document for all interested in the history of Chinese art.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It is also a lucid and fascinating guidebook for the collector or would be collector, both of snuff bottles and other products of Chinese craftsmanship.  All the skills and ingenuity of the Chinese artisans were lavished upon the production of these tiny bottles, making them pre-eminent representatives of the best in Chinese craftsmanship.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This classic art history book is the first full account in any language of this facet of Chinese art.  It includes a comprehensive treatment of the origins and development of the snuff bottle in China as well as over 150 actual-size reproductions, the majority in full color.  It is a fascinating story by an enthusiastic collector, who captivated by the beauty and ingenuity found in these bottles, had the interest to delve into the historical background techniques of manufacture, kind and quality of materials, classification and organization of types, and the like, as well as a delightfully informal style with which to communicate her wide knowledge and enthusiasm to the reader.&lt;/div&gt;" />
