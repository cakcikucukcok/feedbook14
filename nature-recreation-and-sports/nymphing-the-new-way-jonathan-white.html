  <title>Nymphing - the new way - Jonathan White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;French nymphing, or European nymphing as it is often known in the US, is the most important new development in flyfishing for a generation. The use of ultra-long tapered French leaders provides huge advantages both in terms of reducing drag and dramatically improving fly presentation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
These methods, which have already revolutionised the world of competition flyfishing, are now also proving themselves to be a game-changer for the recreational fisherman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the first book to explain all branches of French leader technique:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• sight nymphing&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• short and long-range indicator nymphing&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• dry fly&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• fishing for grayling, carp and steelhead&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• masterclasses from leading experts&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cody Burgdorff (USA)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Julien Daguillanes (France)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stanislav Mankov (Bulgaria)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• tips for fishing in all types of river and clear stillwaters in the UK, Continental Europe, the USA and the Southern Hemisphere.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Use of the French leader has led to the French national team becoming the most successful team at the World Championships in recent years, winning 7 Gold, 7 Silver and 7 Bronze medals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As opportunities to catch trout on a dry fly have become less frequent and of shorter duration, the use of modern nymphing techniques can often make the difference between a successful fishing trip and not catching fish at all.&lt;/p&gt;" />
