  <title>A Liver Runs Through It - River Dick Doc</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Liver Runs Through It tells the legendary, four-decade-long, story of the annual 4Day canoe and kayak trip taking place each year on the rivers of Michigans Upper Peninsula. The reader can hear the pfsst of beers opening and smell the cigar smoke swirling about the bourbon-soaked history of the 4Day, as it comes to life in stories told among paddlers on the river, round the evening campfire, and bellied up to northern bars, the timeless yin
It is with awe that we stand, two paddling hours upstream from the Fox River Campground, at the top of the well-named Fox River Overlook, this years launch site, with its spectacular view 150 above the winding river valley below. We talk of how, almost 2,000 years ago, this view must have affected the Native American Ojibwa, les Ojibwes, when they first walked to the edge of this cliff. Silence falls over the boys, a rare respite from jokes n stories, as they absorb the scene the pines across the valley and tag alders crowding the Fox below, the rivers gorgeous dark reddish-brown color the result of tannins, the decaying leaves and other vegetation along the riverside.
&amp; yang... Some get there by canoe, some get there by car, theyre all lookin for Andys, Andys Seney Bar." />
