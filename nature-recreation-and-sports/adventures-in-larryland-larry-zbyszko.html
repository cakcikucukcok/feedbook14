  <title>Adventures in Larryland! - Larry Zbyszko</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Wrestling&#39;s self-proclaimed &quot;Living Legend&quot; may never wear a championship belt again, but he&#39;s definitely not down for the count. Adventures in Larryland! is the entertaining, often hilarious story of Larry Zbyszko&#39;s remarkable ascent to wrestling notoriety.
Voted &quot;Rookie of the Year&quot; in 1974, Zbyszko enjoyed 30 glorious years as a top draw in the wild and wacky world of professional wrestling. Attendance records were shattered when he wrestled the original &quot;Living Legend,&quot; Bruno Sammartino, in 1980 and achieved victory by hitting his former mentor with a chair (a rarity at the time). With that match, Zbyszko stepped out from Sammartino&#39;s shadow and was transformed from a baby-faced hero to one of the most hated wrestlers of his time. Afterwards, Zbyszko was careful to never miss a chance to remind the wrestling world that he had become the &quot;New Living Legend.&quot; 
Later that decade, Zbyszko wrestled former Japanese Olympic wrestler, Masa Sieto, in front of 70,000-plus fans at Japan&#39;s Tokyodome. In the late 1990&#39;s, he became a high-profile color commentator for the Atlanta based WCW, and would still put on his boots for special occasions. He&#39;s credited with saving the TNT&#39;s number one rated show, Monday Nitro, from the evil clutches of the &quot;New World Order&quot; and in 1998, Zbyszko&#39;s appearance in back-to-back pay per views produced the two largest buy-rates that WCW had ever had." />
