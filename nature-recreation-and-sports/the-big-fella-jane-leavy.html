Walsh called the tour a &quot;Symphony of Swat.&quot; The &lt;em&gt;Omaha World Herald&lt;/em&gt; called it &quot;the biggest show since Ringling Brothers, Barnum and Bailey, and seven other associated circuses offered their entire performance under one tent.&quot; In &lt;em&gt;The Big Fella&lt;/em&gt;, acclaimed biographer Jane Leavy recreates that 21-day circus and in so doing captures the romp and the pathos that defined Ruth&amp;#8217;s life and times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing from more than 250 interviews, a trove of previously untapped documents, and Ruth family records, Leavy breaks through the mythology that has obscured the legend and delivers the man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
