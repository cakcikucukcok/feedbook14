  <title>Right of Passage - Deborah Richmond Foulkes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;RIGHT OF PASSAGE, What the Dead say about Reincarnation, is Deborah Richmond Foulkes&#39; fifth book written with Spirit. It is the culmination of twelve years of research, including nearly four years spent in Scotland and England, validating the messages the author received from Spirit through original documents and contemporary accounts from the 13th and 14th centuries. The author has combined her academic acumen for historical research with her training as a Spiritual medium. In this book Deborah features several lifetimes of over a dozen souls through information disseminated from Spirit in a new way.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The messages from Spirit came through Deborah&#39;s own mediumship as well as the Spirit communication of other, well known Mediums. Accounts of several of her readings were featured in books by others, including Psychic Medium Lydia Clar with her book OUT OF DARKNESS INTO LIGHT, Spiritual Medium Robert Brown&#39;s first book, WE ARE ETERNAL, and Trance Medium Suzane Northrop&#39;s book, EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON. Deborah also received substantial validation of her work during a public demonstration of Spirit Communication at the Virginia Beach retreat sponsored by Robert Brown. His special guest and friend, medium John Edward, came to Deborah with information that substantiated her own messages from Spirit as well as her validating historical research.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Deborah Richmond Foulkes is a Spiritualist, in the footsteps of her great, great grandmother Elizabeth Foster and her cousin Horace Greely who were early supporters of Spiritualism. Deborah became a Certified Medium in the Spiritualist church. But while communication with the so called dead is accepted among Spiritualists, the concept of multiple incarnations is not. In 2000 Deborah received her first clue about a past life in Scotland. She was able to verify the information from her guide in Spirit through original documents. Other Spirit in her circle began to come forth with proof of their medieval lifetimes. Then in 2006, the Spirit known as Archibald Douglas revealed a more recent lifetime as a young man David Lee who grew up in western Pennsylvania and became a United States Marine.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&quot;I died in a jeep accident, landmine,&quot; Dave explained. That piece of evidence was the first link to a second lifetime that ended in 1968, for the same soul who incarnated in 1296 in Scotland. The author was able to validate through research that the soul had the same personality, with the identical core values, whether he was 2nd Lieutenant Dave Hopkins USMC or Sir Archibald Douglas, Regent of Scotland.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;That important step meant for Spiritualists that the soul is the same lifetime over lifetime. Others in Spirit began to come forward with their evidence of survival. And each time Deborah was able to find historical evidence to validate their claims. The author was also able to show that the soul was identical in each ensuing incarnation. As a breakthrough book on Reincarnation, written with Spirit and validated with historic research, Deborah Richmond Foulkes shares discoveries we all can both understand and believe.&lt;/P&gt;" />
