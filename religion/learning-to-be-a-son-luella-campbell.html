  <title>Learning to Be a Son - Luella Campbell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jesus said, Follow me. It is his primary instruction to his disciples out of which everything else flows. Who is he? He is first and foremost the Son of God. He came to reveal the Father, to clear the way for us to be reinstated as sons and daughters of the Father, and to take us to the Father. 
But what does it mean to be a son or daughter of God? 
You will discover, as you journey through Learning to be a Son, that sonship is the key to everything we are, have, and are to be as members of Gods family. Life is not about us. Its about him. Prayer is not about us. Its about him. And the way we access the Father is through our passwordsonand everything that is enshrined in being a son or daughter of God. This opens the door to unbelievable privileges as well as inescapable responsibilities and unimaginable blessings. 
John summed it up magnificently for us: How great is the love the Father has lavished on us, that we should be called children of God! And that is what we are! (1 John 3:1)." />
