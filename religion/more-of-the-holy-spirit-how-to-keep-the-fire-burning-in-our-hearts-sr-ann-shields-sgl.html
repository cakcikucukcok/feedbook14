  <title>More of the Holy Spirit: How to Keep the Fire Burning in Our Hearts - Sr. Ann Shields, Sgl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the last forty years, many Catholics have experienced an outpouring of the Holy Spirit in their lives that resulted in a new passion for God and a zeal for spreading the gospel. In addition to a newfound love of prayer, Scripture, and the Eucharist, many have been blessed with the supernatural gifts of the Holy Spirit, such as tongues and healing. Yet as the years go by, many often experience a waning of the gifts of the Spirit as well as a lukewarmness creeping into their lives. What can we do so that fire for God, which may have been ignited many years ago, will continue to burn brightly in our hearts?  In this book, Sr. Ann Shields offers us an inspirational message that will help us to persist in prayer and keep asking for more of the Holy Spirit in our lives each day. By taking a serious look at our hearts and repenting where we have strayed, and by staying close to God in Scripture and the Eucharist, we can reignite the fire that once burned within us." />
