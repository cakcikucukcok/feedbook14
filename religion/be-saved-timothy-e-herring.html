  <title>Be Saved! - Timothy E. Herring</title>
      <meta name="description" content="God is crying out loud for his people. Thousands upon thousands of his children are dying unsaved! Our gangsters, our wayward teens, our ex-prisoners, and our young adults belong to God. They belong to us also. All is ours! We must face the blame. We created them. We created conditions that produced them. We shut down the mandatory military draft, the one sure way of teaching self-discipline, self-restraint, obedience, and responsibility to young adults prior to adulthood. Our Industrial Revolution paled in the light of the Technological Revolution, where high-paying apprenticeships and other jobs were given to robotics; one robot replaced twenty hard-working men with large families. Most of the remaining manufacturing jobs were shipped abroad, and the Industrial Revolution mud-bottomed out. Fast-food jobs were unable to support their families. We took away the industrial schools for delinquents who had large families; we gave these schools to the robotically displaced. Delinquents were pushed into jobs that could not support families. We made shotgun weddings disappear, so did the fathers. Where did they all go? They didnt go. They were pushed into the streets to survive. Pimps, drug dealers, confidence scammers, strong-arm robbers, gangsters, and identity thieves became the order of the day.
Time is running out! The same thousands upon thousands of our wayward teenagers, gangsters, ex-prisoners, and young adults are falling through the cracks. Baby-killing spirits, seducing spirits, spirits of witchcraft, and spirits of divination are operating without walls in the metropolitan areas of the United States. 
This is of great concern to all saved people. We all recognize it, speak of it, and desire to do something about it. The task to overcome is so great we dont know where to begin! Some has even given up, referring to it as the Signs of the Times. We continue to do our church thing. We continue to do our televangelists thing. We continue to do our international thing. We continue to strive for bigness. All of these is vitally important and must continue. But more is needed that speaks directly to gangsters, wayward teens, ex-prisoners, and young adults. More effort is needed to get their souls saved. If they come during the street ministrys call, thats great. We say we love you. But we will not call you directly to be saved." />
