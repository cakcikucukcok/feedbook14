      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Washed Away &lt;/i&gt;centers on an ordinary family man, whose faith is founded only in himself. He sustains a serious head injury during a fishing trip and is trapped on his boat, at the mercy of a raging storm on Lake Superior. The injury causes him to fall in and out of consciousness and launches him into the past, where events during the time of Christ and his own past are re-enacted. Each event has a message he will find to be of the utmost importance. As he moves between two worlds, he finds himself slowly losing his life and sanity in one while discovering hope and perhaps salvation in another.&lt;/p&gt;" />
