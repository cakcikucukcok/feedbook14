  <title>The Duty of Reformation In Light of God&#39;s Mercies - Dr. C. Matthew McMahon, Thomas Gouge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Thomas Gouge (1605-1681), was an English Puritan, (son of the famous William Gouge) and a powerful Reformed minister.  This treatise is about reformation. It is set within the framework of being more holy, because reformation means &quot;reformation of life&quot; in light of Jesus Christ&#39;s saving benefits and God&#39;s abundant saving mercies.   What makes this treatise so excellent is not only its theological and practical depth (and it is deep), but its vivid directness. Gouge, uncompromisingly from Ezra 9:13-14, is going to tell Christians (not just sinners) that if they sin, expect judgment. And, if Christians sin collectively (as a Christian nation), expect collective judgment.  Gouge says, &quot;When Christians will not reform their ways, God replies, they have not minded my mercies, I will not mind their miseries.&quot;   This work is not a scan or facsimile, has been carefully transcribed by hand being made easy to read in modern English, and has an active table of contents for electronic versions." />
