  <title>A Good Year - Mark Oakley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How can we enter fruitfully into the seasons of the Church&#39;s year? Why have the seasons become shaped as they have and what can we do to make them good?  As Mark Oakley explains in the hugely enjoyable, earthy and wide-ranging introduction to this exceptional volume, we can experience them in stimulating company! Here are reflections by the most senior pastors and teachers in the Church today:  SARAH MULLALLY, Bishop of Crediton, on A Good Advent, a season &#39;pregnant with hope&#39;, when our waiting is anything but inactive.  ROWAN WILLIAMS, Master of Magdalene College, Cambridge, on A Good Christmas, and the overwhelming surprise of &#39;a God who values our humanity beyond all imagining&#39;.  LIBBY LANE, Bishop of Stockport, on A Good Epiphany, when through discomfort &#39;we begin to discover at first hand the hospitality of God&#39;.  JUSTIN WELBY, Archbishop of Canterbury, on A Good Lent, &#39;which takes hold of human sinfulness and, in an extraordinary way, makes space for the hope of Christ&#39;.  STEPHEN COTTRELL, Bishop of Chelmsford, on A Good Holy Week, when we &#39;revel in the sensuous and very hands-on re-enactment of liturgical drama&#39;.  STEPHEN CONWAY, Bishop of Ely, on A Good Easter, which is &#39;life lived shot through with grace and glory&#39;.  KAREN GORHAM, Bishop of Sherborne, on A Good Pentecost, when our life&#39;s journey &#39;brings us encounters, challenges and opportunities we can rise to, equipped by the Spirit of God&#39;." />
