  <title>A Mormons Thoughts and Quotes - E. Verl Adams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I started saving some of these thoughts before I went on a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in 1952 to 1954.
I dont pretend to be the only one that has thoughts that are worth saving. I just started saving them, and it grew into this thing.
Also, there are thoughts that I have collected from others that I have saved, and I have included some of my favorites.
I have put dates on my latest thoughts. But I didnt worry about dates way back when I started saving this stuff.
Maybe some of this has subconsciously come from remembering stuff from other people, so I went back and checked on a lot of it on the Gospel Link program for duplication, and I was able to get authors for some of them.
I tried to avoid quoting anyone without giving them credit. But sometimes I have heard others use some of these sayings in their talks after I recorded them." />
