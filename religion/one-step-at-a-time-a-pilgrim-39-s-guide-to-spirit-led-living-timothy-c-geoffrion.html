  <title>One Step at a Time: A Pilgrim&#39;s Guide to Spirit-Led Living - Timothy C. Geoffrion</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Each year, tens of thousands of pilgrims walk el Camino de Santiago--the Way of St. James--a 500-mile route across northern Spain that has existed for over a thousand years. Tim Geoffrion, author of The Spirit-Led Leader, made this pilgrimage with his wife and teenage sons in 2006. He writes in One Step at a Time not about his own journey but about how God works in those who seek to be led by the Spirit. Using pilgrimage as a metaphor for the Spirit-led life, he offers his experiences, thoughts, and reflections as a catalyst for readers&#39; own spiritual pilgrimage--the lifelong journey of growth into the life Christ intends for us. Geoffrion has written so that readers can learn to recognize God&#39;s activity in our lives, to live more fully in God&#39;s love, to follow Jesus Christ according to our unique calling and purpose, and to let the Holy Spirit fill and lead us in every aspect of the journey. One Step at a Time is for those who value spiritual vitality and growth enough to learn how to live Spirit-led lives. It is for those willing to invest sufficient time and energy into seeking and finding the spiritual treasures available to us. It is for those who are seeking to better root their lives in God and orient themselves around spiritual truths. Whether or not we ever travel a path like el Camino, we each walk a spiritual pilgrimage, one step at a time." />
