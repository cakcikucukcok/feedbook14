  <title>Harmonizing the Gospels - Dan Jensen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is very common to read or hear that the biblical Gospels cannot be harmonized. In fact, many go so far as to mock any attempts at resolution as a fools errand. This phenomenon, often combined with other attacks on the biblical text, can cause Christians to doubt the trustworthiness of Scripture, along with adding fuel to the fire of those that would seek to discredit the faith. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Harmonizing the Gospels, Dan Jensen walks the reader through the Gospel of Matthew, carefully comparing it to the other three Gospels and demonstrating in a point-by-point fashion that no contradictions exist between the four biblical Gospels. Many works have addressed alleged contradictions among the Gospels as part of broader themes and therefore often do not address every major accusation of contradiction. Furthermore, many of these works are either highly technical or are at the very least somewhat technical. Harmonizing the Gospels, on the other hand, sufficiently answers the objections of skeptics while remaining highly readable for all audiences and avoiding many other subjects so as to keep the work reasonably short and manageable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have your faith strengthened and learn how you can answer the accusations of alleged contradiction that are so often leveled at the Gospels by skeptics of the Bible by delving into Harmonizing the Gospels today. &lt;/p&gt;" />
