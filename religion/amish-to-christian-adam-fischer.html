  <title>Amish to Christian - Adam Fischer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is the true story of an innocent little Amish boy who grew up in southern Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. After running around with the Amish youth and getting involved with drinking, pornography, and drugs, he decided to leave the Amish faith, because he didnt believe the Amish were living by Gods standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He struggled with addictions for fifteen years and eventually moved away from Lancaster County, finding God and then walking away from God, and going on to live in complete sin. He married a non-Christian woman and soon found himself living in hell on earth. After three years of marriage, his wife decided she was going to kill them both, one way or another. God stepped into his life and freed him through salvation. He discovered a mighty power in the Holy Spirit. God changed his life and wants to do the same in your life. You just have to make a spot for Him in your life. Jesus Christ has a free gift for you, and all you have to do is receive it before it is too late.&lt;/p&gt;" />
