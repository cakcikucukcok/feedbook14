They are looking for help, relief, and wisdom to navigate the countless options that life offers on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This book is needed by people who&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Go to bed with a &quot;To Do&quot; list that never seems to get totally done.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kindly say, &quot;Yes&quot; and secretly regret it five minutes later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feel pain and live with guilt when they have to say, &quot;No.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Were taught that &quot;No&quot; is a dirty word.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Believe that saying &quot;No&quot; is a sign of weakness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feel trapped by unwise past commitments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Want to say &quot;Yes&quot; to what matters most in life but are too exhausted.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Know that their life is out of balance and are seeking to fix it!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It will be valuable for&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leaders who have a tough time making the hard decisions because they fear hurting someone&#39;s feelings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Executives who feel over extended and pressed to the edges of their capacity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Parents who feel overworked and under appreciated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Students who are trying to balance the intensity of school, work, and their relational world.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Retired people who find themselves saying, with subtle humor but aching regret, &quot;I am more busy now than I have ever been!&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Single people who go to bed at night exhausted because the day left no margin and offered no oasis of peace.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Married people who love their life but secretly dream about time to play, space to relax, and taking a nap.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Is a Beautiful Word&lt;/em&gt; is designed to be read briskly, chewed on thoroughly, and acted on practically. The chapters are brief by intention. They range from one paragraph (that&#39;s right, some chapters are only a few sentences long!) to four pages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal of this book is give people clear concepts, paint a picture of what it looks like to live out the idea, and then move on to the next thought. The vision is to help people learn to say &quot;No&quot; to the things that don&#39;t matter (or don&#39;t matter as much) so they can say &quot;Yes&quot; to the things that bring life, hope, peace, and lasting meaning.&lt;/p&gt;" />
