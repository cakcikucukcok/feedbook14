  <title>The 3 Visible Advents of Jesus - Earl Schrock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="LEARN MORE ABOUT THE THREE LITERAL VISIBLE ADVENTS OF JESUS.
The message of the FIRST ANGEL of Revelation 14:6, 7 should encourage each one of us to ask:
AM I READY FOR JESUS TO COME? 
Behold, I am coming quickly, and my reward is with me, to render to every man according to what he has done. Revelation 22:12 NASB
Look, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him;
and all peoples on earth will mourn because of him. So shall it be! Amen. Revelation 1:7 NIV
WARNING: Reading this book will not brainwash you. It will not hinder or corrupt your thinking process. It will not cause you to become confused or lose your way spiritually. What it will do is offer a fresh view to help you prepare for the soon coming of Jesus. It will reveal new evidence that you may not have been shown or considered before. Open your spiritual mind and allow the Holy Spirit to guide you into all truth. John 16:13 says, But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all the truth. He will not speak on his own; he will speak only what he hears, and he will tell you what is yet to come.
1. Why are there three physical comings or advents of Jesus?
2. What are each of them for? 
3. Who are each of them for?" />
