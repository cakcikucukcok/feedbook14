  <title>More Than a Whisper - Anne Sano Keller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="More than a Whisper tells the intimate story of Anne Sano Kellers journey from the emptiness of being raised by parents who couldnt love her, to suffering a mothers greatest sorrow, and finally emerging into the fullness of grace. When her heart is shattered and she can no longer go on, the universe shows her its divine plan.
After giving up all hope of reconciliation, Anne receives a letter from her estranged father, who is dying of cancer. She finds herself embarking on a ten-year journey into a world of surrender and forgiveness. As she tries to maintain her normal life, she finds herself living with one foot in this world and one foot in the spirit world.
More than a Whisper started as a private journal meant only for her children to read someday. It became a book when Anne received more than a whisper from her spirit guide and departed loved ones, urging her to tell her story, with the hope that others might take from it the courage to face lifes greatest challenges and ask, What is this here to teach me?" />
