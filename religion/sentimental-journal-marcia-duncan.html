  <title>Sentimental Journal - Marcia Duncan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Marcia Duncan&amp;#39;s Sentimental Journal is designed to be a special book for mothers and daughters. Duncan has been a child therapist for over twenty years and has developed this book as a tool to encourage open communication between mothers and daughters of all ages, from preschool to adult. This touching and heartfelt journal is the perfect gift for any mother or daughter. In this journal, the same questions are posed to both mother and daughter. It can be used as an aid toward developing a more intimate relationship as well as being an important keepsake.&lt;br /&gt;
The purpose of this book is three-fold:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To increase opportunities for communication&lt;br /&gt;
To help mothers and daughters know each other better&lt;br /&gt;
To encourage mothers and daughters to learn from each other&amp;#39;s perspectives&lt;br /&gt;
Praise for Marcia Duncan&amp;#39;s Work:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#39;&amp;#39;At last, here&amp;#39;s something useful to address modern communication issues between mothers and daughters.&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;br /&gt;
- Sharon Tomas, MA, former Chief, Children&amp;#39;s Mental Health Team Hawaii&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#39;&amp;#39;Ms. Duncan&amp;#39;s Sentimental Journal is a most creative, thoughtful, empathetic, sensitive, skillful, gentle, caring approach to improving the relationship between a mother and her daughter. It is simple yet structured enough in its design to make it both safe and non-threatening. It deals with positives and strengths rather than problems and negatives.&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
- Dr. Richard L. Moon, Child Psychiatrist, Madison, Wisconsin&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#39;&amp;#39;Sentimental Journal by Marcia Duncan is a well-thought-out publication that challenges, encourages, and counsels a parent to develop practical knowledge and skills in communication with her daughter. Sentimental Journal provides a vehicle for closer communication between mother and daughter. Those who will accept the challenge and take seriously the gentle direction from this book will find the unfolding of a deep, loving, healthy, and lasting relationship. The payoff is priceless.&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;br /&gt;
