  <title>The Greatest Story Never Told - Audrey Carr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The story of Jesus is well-known worldwide. But have you ever wondered if it is the true and complete story of the Savior? Could there be more to the Son of God?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Author Audrey Carr addresses those questions in &lt;em&gt;The Greatest Story Never Told: An Advanced Understanding of Christianity. &lt;/em&gt;She not only presents the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;real story of Jesus, in which he did not die on the cross, but also includes&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;his unitary gospel of oneness with God that traditional Christianity has&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;missed. Quoting from highly documented, scholarly works, this story of Jesus&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;incorporates Judaism, Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism. With&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;details and maps of his many years in India, Carr provides a photograph&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;of his real tomb in Kashmir. Carr also offers information about meditation&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;techniques he practiced, for Jesus was not a Christian but a Hindu-Buddha!&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;The Kingdom of Heaven was his term for Enlightened Consciousness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other scholarly books, &lt;em&gt;The Greatest Story Never Told &lt;/em&gt;is intended for the everyday person. Readers will come away with a new, meaningful, life-changing understanding of Jesus and his teachings. Carr seeks to destroy what is false and resuscitate the real truth, beyond all myths, and she reveals the connections between major religions. Spiritually uplifting and challenging, &lt;em&gt;The Greatest&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Story Never Told &lt;/em&gt;is for anyone who is ready for an advanced understanding of Jesus and all the other God-men of the ages who have realized their divine identity.&lt;/p&gt;" />
