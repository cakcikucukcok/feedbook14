      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Many have called the psalms a &#39;school of prayer&#39; and indeed St. Augustine in his &lt;i&gt;Confessions&lt;/i&gt; wrote that the psalms could be a stepping stone to deeper conversation with God. These ancient words from Scripture mirror our own thoughts and emotions&amp;mdash;celebration and praise, suffering and lament, gratitude and asking for help&amp;mdash;as relevant today as when they were first sung in the Temple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fr. Martin Shannon brings deep teaching as well as the personal encounter of someone who has chanted and studied the Psalms for years. Each reflection is on one psalm, offering a meditation on its meaning and how it connects to our lives, followed by a word from one of the ancient church fathers and a prayer. There is a reflection for each of the forty-seven days from Ash Wednesday to Easter that reflect the various twists and turns on the Lenten journey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Readers will discover the power of the psalms to inspire their own Lenten journey towards Easter.&lt;/p&gt;" />
