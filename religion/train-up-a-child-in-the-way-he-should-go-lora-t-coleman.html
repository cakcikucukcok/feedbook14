  <title>Train up a Child in the Way He Should Go . . . - Lora T. Coleman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is written: And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD (Genesis 4:1). It is also written: And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children which God hath graciously given thy servant (Genesis 33:5). Granted, the Bible doesnt go on to say Then Adam knew Eve his wife again, and she bare Paula or Barbara or Stephanie or Lisa. However, since man has not proven otherwise, its evident that children come from God. And according to Psalm 127:3; children are a heritage of the Lord and that the fruit of the womb is his reward.
Now toy companies, car manufacturers, and electronic engineers all provide instructions for taking care of and repairing their products. Is it not reasonable to believe that God, the Creator and Ruler of the universe, would do as much and more in giving the gift of life? This is second book of a series is a collaboration of chapters taken from the authors original book entitled Let Integrity and Uprightness Preserve Me . . . It was written to give all parents, grandparents, and anyone caring for children Gods instructions on how to bring these amazing little human beings up in the way they should go, in the love and admonition of the Lordand all for the glory of God." />
