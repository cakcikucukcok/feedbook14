  <title>I Will Lift up My Eyes - Ann Davis Melton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Does God still speak to us? Can Gods voice still be heard today? Do miracles really happen? Is there a difference in praise and prayer? Is God able to make something beautiful out of the worst situations? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To these questions, Ann Melton gives a resounding Yes! She has experienced God in success and failure, illness and heartache, work and play. In this book you can see that through all her encounters with God, she has discovered that any form of sincere believing prayer directs Gods power into our lives and this is especially true of prayer blended with praise. It is possible for anyone to have a close walk with the Lord. Simply by calling his name and pouring out your heart to him, miracles can happen.&lt;/p&gt;" />
