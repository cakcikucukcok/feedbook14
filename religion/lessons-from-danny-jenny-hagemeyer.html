  <title>Lessons from Danny - Jenny Hagemeyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Ecclesiastes 3:4 says, There is a time to weep and a time to laugh, a time to mourn and a time to dance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In Lessons from Danny there will be moments you will cry and moments that bring laughter. Did you ever wonder what your pets would say if they could talk? After all, God spoke through a donkeys mouth in the Bible. I encourage you to envision with me as our little mixed Shih Tzu, Danny, gives his version of his testimony of a time in his life that he came to the brink of dying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;In February 2012 Danny became very ill. The veterinarian had taken x-rays and found a mass on Dannys stomach that was the size of a softball. He told us Danny wouldnt live longer than one week. We were broken hearted and wept for our little guy. How could this be happening? He was like our little child and part of our family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;You will be amazed how God led Fred and Jenny day by day with His wisdom and direction for their loving little Danny. Join Dannys class as he teaches lessons led by the Holy Spirit!&lt;/p&gt;" />
