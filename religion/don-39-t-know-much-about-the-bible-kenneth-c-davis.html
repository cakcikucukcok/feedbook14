  <title>Don&#39;t Know Much About the Bible - Kenneth C. Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With wit, wisdom, and an extraordinary talent for turning dry, difficult reading into colorful and realistic accounts, the creator of the bestselling &lt;em&gt;Don&#39;t Know Much About&amp;#174;,&lt;/em&gt; series now brings the world of the Old and New testaments to life as no one else can in the bestseller &lt;em&gt;Don&#39;t Know Much About&amp;#174; The Bible.&lt;/em&gt; Relying on new research and improved translations, Davis uncovers some amazing questions and contradictions about what the Bible really says. Jericho&#39;s walls may have tumbled down because the city lies on a fault line. Moses never parted the Red Sea. There was a Jesus, but he wasn&#39;t born on Christmas and he probably wasn&#39;t an only child. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis brings readers up-to-date on findings gleaned from the Dead Sea Scrolls and Gnostic Gospels that prompt serious scholars to ask such serious questions as: Who wrote the Bible? Did Jesus say everything we were taught he did? Did he say more? By examining the Bible historically, Davis entertains and amazes, provides a much better understanding of the subject, and offers much more fun learning about it. &lt;/p&gt;" />
