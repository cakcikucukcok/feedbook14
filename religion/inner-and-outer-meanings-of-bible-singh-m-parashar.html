  <title>Inner and Outer Meanings of Bible - Singh M. Parashar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This work has been dedicated to those Jews who were handed over to the Nazis. A bible is composed of good news and bad news. The divine Bible is infallible, and the human Bible is fallible (due to an absence of inner meanings). We should throw out all unscientific facts from the Bible. Torah is the journey from the temple to synagogue, from the priest to learned rabbis, and from revelations to reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judaism is a change from the path of devotion to the path of knowledge and good deeds. Judaism tells us that God has no rival and God is greater than nature. Nature is the rival of God. Judaism says that God is the author of good and evil. Good is from God, and evil is from nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marx wrongly believed in historical materialism. Historical events took place according to historical spiritualism. Geographical boundaries were changed again and again after the birth of a new religion or sect. The creator of a thing will always try to make use of the thing created by him. Infinite area of land on other planets is lying unused. Such a consideration causes us to say that the world is eternal. It is claimed that a woman with six or more breasts can descend on earth either by scientific means or by confining the circle of marriages within those families who give birth to two or more children at one time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is concerned with the spirit, and God is not concerned with physical body. The physical body of every man is fully under the control of the causal laws of nature. God and nature are not identical.&lt;/p&gt;" />
