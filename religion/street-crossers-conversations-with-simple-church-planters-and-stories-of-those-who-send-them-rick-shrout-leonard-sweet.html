  <title>Street Crossers: Conversations with Simple Church Planters and Stories of Those Who Send Them - Rick Shrout, Leonard Sweet</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Imagine traditional congregations in the United States and Canada sending missionaries across the street from their church buildings to express the kingdom of God within a postmodern culture and among disenfranchised Christians. The possibilities and potential are endless. This concept is explored and actual examples are presented in Street Crossers. Partnerships between traditional churches and nontraditional simple church planters are rare. More need to be encouraged because a significant number of people across North America are skeptical of organized religion or want nothing to do with church-as-usual. While some might conclude that the traditional church has little to offer a postmodern world and that no amount of tweaking traditional church structures will make a significant difference, they have forgotten to consider a vital reality existing in most congregations across the land: a commitment to send and support missionaries to foreign cultures. It&#39;s time to harness this existing commitment and focus it across the street." />
