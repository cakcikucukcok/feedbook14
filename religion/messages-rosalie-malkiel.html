KIRKUS REVIEW 
In her debut, Malkiel argues that most of lifes strange coincidences are actually divine messages.
Throughout my life, I have had strange experiences that have convinced me that there can be
communication between God and man, the author begins. The remainder of the book elaborates on this one
statement, starting with the story of her birth. Malkiels mother, being of poor health, safely delivered her unaided
by nurses or doctors on the 18th of Januarya number that, Malkiel explains, denotes life in the Jewish faith.
Scores of stories follow this one, each describing how the author interpreted an event or strange happenstance as a
message from God. The stories are not presented chronologically, so confusion could arise about when in the
authors life a particular story fits, although the confusion remains mild enough to avoid distracting too severely
from the the books theme. Some events seem quite notable: Malkiels dream about her aunt drowning, only to discover that her aunt had drowned
around the time of the dream. Many others, however, seem rather mundane, to the point where one could argue that only someone actively
seeking examples of divine communication would find them here. Readers of faith may find it easy to relate to Malkiels conclusions. But, despite
the wide range of experiences mentioned in the book, skeptics may not find satisfactory evidence to convince them of divine communication.
While some nonreligious readers could potentially draw meaning from the text, it will hold far greater appeal to individuals who not only believe
in a higher power, but who also share Malkiels belief about lines of communication existing between that mysterious power and humanity. That
said, the book may prove a blessing for believers. Its casual tone makes the text more personal and engaging, and some readers could reaffirm
their own beliefs and experiences by reading about Malkiels.
An uncomplicated work that demonstrates how even the simplest life can be filled with touches of the divine, provided you choose to look
for it.
