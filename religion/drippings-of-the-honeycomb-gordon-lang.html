  <title>Drippings of the Honeycomb - Gordon Lang</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What you seewrite in a book.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Rev 1:19	&lt;i&gt;Therefore write the things which you have seen ...&lt;/i&gt; This book is a compilation of a variety of personal life experiences, spiritual applications to everyday situations, and scriptural teachings that the Lord has given author Gordon Lang to share with the Body of Christ. It is his hope that, within the pages of this book, the reader will find encouragement in the face of past experiences, spiritual insight for their present-day life, and a source of confidence to face whatever the future may hold.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Romans 8:28	&lt;i&gt;And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.&lt;/i&gt; This verse has given Lang cause to rejoice at times when God has blessed him beyond his wildest dreams. It has been his solid foundation in times of bitter disappointment and overwhelming grief. The reader is invited to join Lang in both extremes of his personal experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke 12:27	&lt;i&gt;Consider the lilies, how they grow &lt;/i&gt; Jesus often used illustrations from everyday life in order to teach His disciples spiritual truths. He still does the same today. Come with Lang as he shares a few of the profound lessons that He has taught him through some of life&#39;s most ordinary situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebrews 4:12	&lt;i&gt;For the word of God is living and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword &lt;/i&gt; Far from being irrelevant to today&#39;s society, God&#39;s word still contains the answers to life&#39;s most compelling situations. Rejoice with Lang as he researches the immutable truths of the Wordlooking for satisfaction to share with those that hunger and thirst after righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;" />
