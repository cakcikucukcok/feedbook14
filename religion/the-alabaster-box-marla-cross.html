  <title>The Alabaster Box - Marla Cross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Alabaster Box is not a devotional book containing a series of entries designed to inspire the Christian reader with an uplift ing story or thought for the day. It is, as the subtitle suggests, a years worth of worship activities; the implementation of which will require some intensive mental exercise. It is not the book for those wanting a feel-good read. Nor is it for those unwilling or not yet ready to accept a challenge to their typical weekly worship experience. The Alabaster Box is a guidebook for the followers of Christ who long to take their worship of Him to a deeper place than they have ever gone. The objective is that at the end of the years adventures, the reader emerges forever changed. The aroma of the perfume could not be recaptured and returned to the alabaster box broken by the devotee of Jesus day once it had been released. In the same way, no disciple who worships Him today in an extraordinary manner should ever be content to offer anything less thereafter. Nor should he or she be able to view certain aspects of the Christian experience in a simplistic manner after having viewed them through the broken pieces of the alabaster box.
All of the followers of Christ need help with their worship and daily walk with Him. Marla Cross provided a tool with this worship guide for each week of the year to assist us with this challenge. She is a creative person and writer who is using these God-given gifts for His glory.
