  <title>Us the Universe - Svein Harald Haukanes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Who are we? Why are we born into this life just to die and disappear again? Where do we come from, and where do we go? Every day, the earths population is growing at an exponential rate. If we have souls and are not just pails of meat, where do all the new souls come from? 
All these questions and more have been tumbling around in my head since I was young. My whole life, I have been searching with an open mind for answers. The last few years, I have found many that I will try to share with you. 
There are about seven billion of us here on earth. Most of us believe in some kind of religion, and these religions tell us, Do what we tell you and dont start thinking for yourself. Even though these religions try to control us, I think there are some good things and some truth in them as well. Its just that they have become such man-made products. 
People with the need for power are attracted to religions as well as politics, business, and financial power systems. All these things have built up a trust-and-believe system where we are deactivated as thinkers, so we have stopped doing the necessary thinking and reflection ourselves. 
In this book, we are going to open up our minds and start asking questions. We are going to take in a lot of obvious ideas and analyze them. Not so long ago, we were thinking that the earth was flat, that the sun circled around the earth, and that the earth was the centre of the universe. All this was very true at that time, but not anymore. 
In this book, we are going to see what else we have to reconsider. The time is here." />
