  <title>Touched with Instructions - Eyana Adah McMillan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="GET TOUCHED WITH INSTRUCTIONS AND OBEY THE LORD&#39;S WAY TO VICTORY 
&lt;p&gt;
The Lords touch is more than an emotional moment experienced during a worship service or private devotional time.&lt;br&gt; 
So why does the Lord touch us? &lt;br&gt;
In Touched With Instructions, we will learn the Lords answers to this question.&lt;br&gt; 
We&#39;ll be led on a journey through the Bible and our lives to discover the purposes, changes and assignments that come with the Lord&#39;s touches. We&#39;ll learn about the victory of obedience and the devastation of disobedience. &lt;br&gt;
We&#39;ll gain insight into how the Lord&#39;s instructions help us discern deception and overcome failures. And we&#39;ll see how the Lord grants instruction blessings to effective leaders who remain His humble students. &lt;br&gt;
Awaiting us are instructions that will challenge, correct and revive us. Well have times of prayer, repentance and praise as we surrender ourselves to the Lords touches of compassion, encouragement, forgiveness and love. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Our instruction topics include:&lt;br&gt; 
Going for a Victory Walk through Enemy Situations&lt;br&gt;
The Blessing of Being Second &lt;br&gt;
Boot Camp for the Ears &lt;br&gt;
Homework for the Tongue &lt;br&gt;
Accepting Rejection &lt;br&gt;
Write Right &lt;br&gt;
Outnumbered but Not Overpowered&lt;br&gt; 
Final Victory &lt;br&gt;
Intimately Touching the Lord&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
The Lords touch is just the beginning. There are lessons to learn and directions to receive. So lets get started and get Touched With Instructions!" />
