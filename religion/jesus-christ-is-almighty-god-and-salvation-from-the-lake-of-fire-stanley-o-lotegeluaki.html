  <title>Jesus Christ Is Almighty God and Salvation from the Lake of Fire. - Stanley O. Lotegeluaki</title>
      <meta name="description" content="JESUS DIED INSTEAD OF YOU. HE WAS PUNISHED FOR YOUR SINS AS YOUR SUBSITUTE. INSTEAD OF YOU BEING PUNISHED, HE WAS PUNISHED SO YOU COULD WALK AWAY  FREE. HE WAS THE SINLESS LAMB SACRIFICED FOR ALL PEOPLE, NO MATTER WHAT SIN YOU&#39;VE COMMITTED. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS BELIEVE THAT JESUS IS THE SALVATION FROM BEING BURNED ALIVE FOREVER IN THE LAKE OF FIRE, AND YOU ARE SAVED. THE LAKE OF FIRE IS THE CORE OF THE  IMPLODED UNIVERSE OF FIERY STARS AND HOT GALAXIES MELTED TOGETHER AS EINSTEIN , JESUS , PETER AND PAUL SAID WILL HAPPEN. HOW COULD AN ANCIENT DOCUMENT LIKE THE BIBLE TALK ABOUT THE COLLAPSE OF THE UNIVERSE, MATTERS THAT SCIENCE IS JUST GRAPPLING WITH TODAY?  MATHEW 24:35, LUKE 21:33 II PETER 3:7,12.
JUST BELIEVE IN JESUS.
JOHN 3:14-18
14.  And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:
 15.  That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.
 16.  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
 17.  For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.
 18.  He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
JOEL 2:32
&quot;AND IT SHALL COME TO PASS, THAT WHOSOEVER SHALL CALL ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE DELIVERED: FOR IN MOUNT ZION AND JERUSALEM SHALL BE DELIVERANCE, AS THE LORD HATH SAID, AND IN THE REMNANT WHOM THE LORD SHALL CALL.&quot;
