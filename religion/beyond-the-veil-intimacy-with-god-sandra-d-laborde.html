  <title>Beyond the Veil: Intimacy with God - Sandra D. Laborde</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;BEYOND THE VEIL: INTIMACY WITH GOD is a true account of author Sandra Labordes year-long journey of being set apart with the Lord. During that year Sandra encountered many rough terrains as she learned how to trust God. Her journey begins as she seeks to know God intimately. While on this journey, God begins to work in the deep recesses of her heart, removing hidden areas of shame, fear, and unforgiveness. As the veils were removed from her heart she became purified spiritually, physically, and emotionally. As she allowed Holy Spirit to cleanse her heart she was able to draw closer to God- but she experienced great pain along the journey. While climbing the mountain of intimacy she discovered the transforming power of the love of God, the Father. During the purification process Sandras passion for Jesus deeply intensified as she encountered the heart and emotions of God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
