  <title>Gypsy the Gem Dealer - Ivor Blimsworth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is planned as the first in a series of five that tell the story of our character Gypsy. This book tells the story of Gypsys first ten years on the road......the first 120 pages primarily are set in Israel, Greece and other parts of Europe but after the first 166 pages the story really takes off as he makes his first trip to India then onwards into Australia before going back up into Asia for a journey to Japan, then back to Nepal and India......then we follow Gypsys adventures as he attempts to set himself up as a gem dealer........all the while he is on a spiritual search and this is a theme of the book as he searches for enlightenment and the knowledge of what lies beyond death......in this book a number of religions and spiritual paths are explored by our main character as are a number of different types of drugs. Adventures are had along the way such as gold smuggling, distributing leaflets for a banned organization in China and becoming a senior high school lecturer in Japan with the use of somebody elses papers. I hope that this book will be entertaining for armchair travelers and an inspiration to young would be travelers and adventurers." />
