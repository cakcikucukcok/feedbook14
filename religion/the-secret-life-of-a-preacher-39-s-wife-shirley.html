  <title>The Secret Life of a Preacher&#39;s Wife - Shirley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My sincere hope is that every person in an abusive relationship will get out, and that the abuser will be changed by realizing the pain and suffering they cause.
When I prayed that God would allow me to marry a preacher, somewhere in my mind I thought it would guarantee me a life of love, peace, and happiness.
Nothing was further from the truth. After all, preachers are men too, clothed in nice suits, shoes, and fancy robes. All my life, I had been around marriages that should have ended years ago. I wanted to be different; I wanted to help people change. I wanted to see men love and cherish their wives.
We all know for the most part at least on the surface that preachers wives seem to be more than happy. Some wear the designer suits and hats with fancy matching shoes. On occasion, I did too. However, I soon found out, at least in my life, it was all superficial.
I was all smiles and encouraging words outside the door, but most days, behind closed doors, my life was a living hell. Three months into my marriage, I began living in a nightmare. I told myself I would never tell anyone. I would help the world believe we had the ideal marriage. Even before the I-dos, I knew there were some problems.
Before long Shirley became a preachers wife with a secret life,and everything in her told her that shes not the only one!" />
