  <title>Out of the Fire - Evangelist Eddie Mae Strauss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is to inspire any man or woman who thought about giving up on
their dreams. Im a living witness that God, will help you through anything.
A product of a single mother on welfare from Cincinnati, Ohio. I lived in
the Ghetto projects, hoping for a better life. There were some people who
thought, I never amount to anything. I had to go through the Fire, me and
my two children. The Fire was like a Flame. Burning for Ever!
They say nothing good come from the project. But thats a lie from the pit
of hell! I started working at the age of 13years old at the N.Y.C.(neighbor
youth core) helping children. I was able to rise from poverty through work
experience. As a teenager, I had low self-esteem and lot of challenging
circumstances. You must have tenacity and resilient to stay focus. Be a
dreamer, like Joseph in the Bible. I remembered the promises of God! You
can make it. Jesus spoke to me and said all things possible through Jesus
Christ." />
