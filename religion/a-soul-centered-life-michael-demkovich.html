  <title>A Soul-Centered Life - Michael  Demkovich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;People today are searching for meaning and purpose. They know that something is missing in their lives and long to fill this void. Many books on spirituality attempt to fill this need, and the approaches are nearly as numerous as the searchers themselves. Such a widespread desire in the human heart speaks to the spiritual hunger at the core of each one of us. It is this hunger of both the head and the heart that Michael Demkovich sees as key to spiritual integration. In this volume readers will rediscover that there really is something more to life, and spirituality meets the mystery of this something more.&quot; A genuine spirituality must address two essential characteristics:&lt;br&gt; &lt;ul&gt;It cannot be meant for an elite few, yet it must answer life&#39;s toughest and most basic questions: How did we get here? What are we destined to become? It recognizes the crucial role of religious tradition and community; it is not merely eclectic and individualized therapy, focused only on &quot;my&quot; well-being.&lt;p&gt;Retrieving a theological understanding of the soul, Demkovich explores an animating spirituality that integrates faith and life, the moral and the intellectual, into an animated spirituality that makes life meaningful and satisfying. &quot;If you find something is missing in the very soul of your being, then I am certain that this book has something for you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Michael Demkovich, OP, is the Gerald Vann Visiting Lecturer in Catholic Thought and Life at Blackfriars, Oxford. He is the founding director of the Dominican Ecclesial Institute in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and holds his doctorate from the Katholiek Universiteit Leuven in Belgium. He is the author of various articles and &lt;/i&gt;Introducing Meister Eckhart&lt;i&gt; (Ligouri, 2006).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&quot;&lt;/div&gt;" />
