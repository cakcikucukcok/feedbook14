      <meta name="description" content="Welcome to the neighborhood of your dreams. Here you&#39;ll find great friends. Help and encouragement. Shared meals and resources. Family gatherings.   These pages present a parade of homes like you&#39;ve never imagined . . . neighborhoods, farms, apartments, and houses in which Christians are discovering the key to contentment in community.  It&#39;s nothing new. Community was God&#39;s idea in the garden. Sure, it was twisted by the fall, but the early church&#39;s example of healthy community is being re-experienced by many believers today.  Maybe you&#39;re considering a move to an intentional community. Or maybe you want to develop deeper friendships and commitment without going anywhere at all. Then read on. These people can lead you to the next step, through engaging stories of brokenness, joyful surrender, creative awakenings, and simple childlikeness.  Enjoy this colorful tour of some of the most alive and authentic communities in America today. This could be the most satisfying journey home that you have ever taken." />
