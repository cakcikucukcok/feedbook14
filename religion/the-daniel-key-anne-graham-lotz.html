  <title>The Daniel Key - Anne Graham Lotz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twenty choices will bring contentment when the world says you aren&amp;rsquo;t enough, closeness born of relationship with God, boldness to share the truth, and peace in times of trial. These choices were made by Daniel, a young Jewish man serving God in a godless society, revered by God, saved from lions. &lt;em&gt;The Daniel Key&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;will lead you to a life-changing faith.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the secrets of a successful, steadfast, and godly faith? Daniel was honored by God, protected, and trusted. His faith did not waver facing those who were against him, serving new kings in power, or even confronting hungry lions. How can you have that kind of faith? Daniel made 20 intentional, key choices in his life. Those choices took him down a path to a close relationship with God and a model for godly living to all around him. Daniel&amp;rsquo;s choices can be your choices&amp;mdash;choices such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The choice to trust&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The choice to obey&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The choice to pray&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The choice to worship&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The choice to repent&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The choice to live humbly&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The choice to have courage&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The choice to serve&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The choice to love&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 20 choices will bring you contentment when the world says you are not enough, closeness born of a relationship with God, boldness to share the truth, and peace in times of trial. &lt;em&gt;The Daniel Key&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;will lead you to a life-changing faith.&lt;/p&gt;" />
