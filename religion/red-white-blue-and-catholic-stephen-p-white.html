  <title>Red, White, Blue, and Catholic - Stephen P. White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Church’s work of evangelization and its contribution to the good of society are inseparable. As Catholics and as American citizens, we are called to do more than just vote and follow a party.
America needs Catholics who are in love with our nation and who act from the deepest convictions of their faith to make America the best version of itself. If we love God and our neighbor, we dedicate ourselves to the vitality of our society. We respond to the needs of our neighbors. We confront both physical poverty and spiritual poverty. Most important, we follow Christ.
As Stephen P. White says, we need Catholic citizens who are Red, White, Blue, and Catholic. This book is a Catholic guide to faithful citizenship for every day of the year—not just Election Day." />
