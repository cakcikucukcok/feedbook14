  <title>The End of the Horizon - Beverly Santiago</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A girl named Sarah was going to the library to get a book, but before she went to the library she had a goal of what she wanted to do it was to be a missionary. She went to the library and found a book that looked interesting, but the library didn&#39;t want her to get that book,  because something bad was going to happen. But Sarah wanted to know what it will be, so she took the book. She went home and opened the book, she then was in a mystery world that no man kind has been into. She was lost and she didn&#39;t know what to do, so she tried to find someone. But she couldn&#39;t she just couldn&#39;t find someone. Until there was a guy who found her and that guy talked different and she couldn&#39;t understand. But there was a God almighty that made her understand what the guy was saying. So she understood. But the question is if she is going back home or if she going to stay there for her rest of her life. You have to read this book to find out. It will be really good and will help you understand how missionary has to go by. You aren&#39;t the only one wanting to be a missionary, because I want to be missionary too. God bless." />
