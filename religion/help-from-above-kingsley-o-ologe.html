  <title>Help from Above - Kingsley O. Ologe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book gives an account of how the author was unjustifiable sacked at the University of Abuja in 1994 and subjected to all manner of harassment before he won his case in court in 1998, and was reinstated in 1999. It includes testimonies of how God took him and his family through the trial by protecting them, supplying their needs and, finally, vindicating him. Finally, it contains spiritual insights that he received from the Scriptures about the Christian pilgrimage through life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book has been written with three objectives in mind: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	To provide a permanent record of what actually happened as a body of evidence arguing against military dictatorship in Nigeria, the enthronement of  mediocrity in positions of authority and the culture of impunity in our national life; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	To demonstrate the power and faithfulness of God in the life of whoever commits himself or herself to Him; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	To enlighten, comfort, encourage and strengthen Christians who may be passing through some form of trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Forward to the book, the Anglican Bishop of Owerri, the Rt. Rev. Cyril C. Okorocha, writes: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Help from above may seem delayed, but it is never denied to a faithful child of a loving, Heavenly Father, Who is also the Lord God Almighty!  This is the message of this book. &lt;/p&gt;" />
