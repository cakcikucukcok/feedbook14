  <title>Journey to the Next Level - Fatai Kasali</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Every human being that has a record of success encountered one difficulty of the other. It is a reality that there are things that hinder progress. Similarly there are things that promote progress. You can&amp;#39;t stay in one position in life because of the fear of things that could potentially hinder your progress. You have to arise and advance. You have to stand on who you are as a Christian and oppose every opposition to your advancement. This book exposes the reality of challenges to progress and also confirms the certainty of success if you refuse to quit. If people that came into this world before you could make progress and rise to the level of significance in their journey, then you don&amp;#39;t have any excuse not to achieve something similar or greater. It is time for you to journey to the next level in every facet of your life!&lt;/p&gt;" />
