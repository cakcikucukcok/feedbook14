  <title>The Black Pentecostal Church: My View from the Pew - Sharon D. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The black Pentecostal church, once the pillar of the community and the standard bearer of the Christian faith was seen as that sanctified, set-aside church, where people came to receive Salvation. The Pentecostal churches comes in every race, creed and color; however, the black Pentecostal church had its own way of worship.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;By writing this book, highlighting issues and situations occurring in the church today, is not to reprimand, insult, or make fun of the church. The purpose of writing this book is to examine the changing standards and the way we go about conducting services, to see if it is expedient for us to maintain these changes in reaching our ultimate goal  winning souls for Christ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, it appears that instead of the church being set-apart, it rather be assimilated with the world. Years ago, one could spot a Saint from a mile away. Today you would be hard pressed to pick one out. Even the very thing that distinguished the Pentecostal church from all other churches, its music, has become indistinguishable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets look at these issues and discuss if we are going down the right path. Let us pray and seek guidance so that we may preserve the church as Jesus wants it to be, a House of Prayer.  Sharon D. Smith, Author &lt;/p&gt;
