  <title>Don’T Be No Fool - Brother William A. Swinton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book has been written for people of all walks of life. It&#39;s message is plain and simple. There is a God, the creator of all things and He has given His Word to all mankind. His Word, or the Bible, was given to mankind by God through the Holy Spirit. God choose to speak to the hearts and minds of many men and woman over a period of hundreds of years to make known to us His Wisdom, Knowledge and Understandings. He also gave us the instructions, or a blueprint, for establishing an everlasting relationship with Him based on His Principles. Believe it or not, God is still speaking to men and woman today! The message of this book is truly a message from God. As you read this book it is recommended that you also have your Bible handy. Use this book as a focal point to identify the differences between the practices of man and the Word of God. Also, please be advised that what God has said is the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Finally, from the Book of Revelations we find these words recorded; 
Revelation: 22: 18 to 20 says; 
18 For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:
19 And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.
20 He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus." />
