  <title>Out of Darkness and into Christ - Rene Pelleya-Kouri M.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Out of Darkness and into Christ is mostly an inspired book. Early in the mornings, I have set up special times of holy visitations and communion with the Lord, in which I received revelation, understanding, wisdom, knowledge, counsel, and even impartation from heaven. Under such anointing, I began to write what I believe what God is releasing for our ministry to help us and to help others. In the introduction, I gave an important testimony referring to my life before Christ, where I searched intensely for God every place I could. And specifically in the psychospiritual area of the imagination, where it is very easy to be deceived, as I was for many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Christ comes, the old passes away, and we become a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17). Under the anointing of the Holy Spirit, we deal with hidden things that prevent our growth. There is a psychology, a Christian one, which we can refer as clinical theology, or progressive sanctification, meaning the rooting out of strongholds and planting of the new life. We receive the authority and power of God, which comes to us as a result of Jesus&#39;s death on the cross and his resurrection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In chapter 4, we teach healing through deliverance. Deliverance, the casting out of evil spirits, was a prominent part of Jesus&#39;s ministry, and we are supposed to do the same (John 14:12). Believers, we cast out demons (Matt 16:17). In our ministry in Africa, a common way to receive physical healing is through deliverance. Chapter 5 is very important. All blessings have been released already, and we have to appropriate them. Many are stuck in blockages to healing, but we show you how to have victory in such opposing strongholds. In chapter 6, we deal with the child. How many people have been wounded, hurt, abused, and traumatized, carrying trauma all their lives? We need to heal the child. Chapter 7, the volcano is an excellent panorama of heaven&#39;s wounds, defenses, and surface smoke (the symptoms of heaven processes). This is a universal problem, and chapter 7 is an eye-opener. Though out this book not only do we expose the problem but we give keys to victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a medical doctor, so every day I see all kinds of infirmities of the spirit, soul, and body. Chapter 9 deals with fibromyalgia. I believe that what we have learned, through the Spirit, on how to heal this decease will help understand the dynamics of diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is about to heal the spirit, soul, and body in the Christian way. This is our daily practices in the medical office, our healing room, on the streets, and in the nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be blessed!&lt;/p&gt;" />
