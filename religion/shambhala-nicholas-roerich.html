  <title>Shambhala - Nicholas Roerich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &amp;quot;Shambhala&amp;quot; N.Roerich has recorded the way of his journey through Central Asia and Tibet in the terms of spirit. It is a record of legends, of parables, of notes--the very substance of which the larger reality is composed, and all revealing different facets of the theme of Shambhala. In this book--as in his other books, &amp;quot;Altai-Himalaya&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Heart of Asia,&amp;quot; one realizes that Roerich&amp;#39;s vision is manifold. Traveling on his way, he discerns all the beauty of the natural spectacle through which he passes. And in his works--as in his paintings--he records this panorama in successive sparks which flow into a continuous pageantry. But in addition, Roerich perceives also that subtler manifestation of the countries and peoples through which he journeys. He discerns their thoughts; he perceives the pulsating, throbbing hopes and beliefs that sweep like winds across space. And it is this record--so little visible to the many of us--that becomes the vital force of Roerich&amp;#39;s message.&lt;br /&gt;
One must remark the style of Roerich--it has the unrepeatable quality and synthesis of life. He transmits to us the essentials and we discern that these fragments of seeming fantasy are weaving themselves into a pattern of essential truth and essential beauty.&lt;br /&gt;
Roerich has named this book, &amp;quot;Shambhala&amp;quot; advisedly. Reading it, one realizes that Roerich has woven a wreath which he has offered in full reverence to the great Principle which is Shambhala, the New Era; for truly it is the salutary wind of people&amp;#39;s thought and faith which will aid the fires of Shambhala. And once again, as in all the deeds of his inexhaustible creative fervor, Roerich&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Shambhala&amp;quot; pronounces the evocation of the fires of new human achievement and a new human destiny.&lt;/p&gt;" />
