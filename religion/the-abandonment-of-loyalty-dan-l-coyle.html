  <title>The Abandonment of Loyalty - Dan L. Coyle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The abandonment of loyalty may be applied to many different issues in life. Here are four abandonments of many: &lt;br&gt;
The abandonment of the living God&lt;br&gt;
The abandonment of marriage between husband and wife &lt;br&gt;
The abandonment of raising ones children in the ways of Jesus Word &lt;br&gt;
The abandonment of Jesus and the Holy Spirit for the American lifestyle and culture &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gods Word says in Hosea 6:4 and 6, What shall I do with you, O Ephraim? What shall I do with you, O Judah? For your loyalty is like a morning cloud And like the dew which goes away early, and, For I delight in loyalty rather than sacrifice, And in the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings (NASB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God destroyed disobedient people in the Old Testament, some of whom were His chosen people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus says in the New Testament, in Luke 6:46, Why do you call Me, Lord, Lord, and do not do what I say? (NASB). Hebrews 13:8 says, Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever (NASB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus will destroy disobedient Christians in the end. Who are His chosen people? Do not kid yourself into thinking that because you are a Christian, you are secure, if you are disobeying Jesus commands.&lt;/p&gt;" />
