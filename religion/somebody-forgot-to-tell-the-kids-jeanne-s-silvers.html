  <title>Somebody Forgot to Tell the Kids - Jeanne S. Silvers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a nation rampant with political confusion, economic upheaval, societal splintering, a breakdown in simple civility, and the reality of fractured families, its difficult to even imagine what todays young people may face in fifty to sixty years. The future of our children, our grandchildren, and our great-grandchildren rests squarely upon our shoulders. In Somebody Forgot to Tell the Kids, author Jeanne S. Silvers examines the state of the world from the churchs perspective.
Through this discussion, she addresses a conundrum: Is the church in America largely ineffective today because of the depraved state of our society, or is our society in that corrupt state because the church is largely ineffective? Silvers uses personal anecdotes and stories from Scripture to present her ideas about leaving a legacy of Christian values for modern youth.
Somebody Forgot to Tell the Kids examines how our world has become what it has and provides solutions for turning it around and beginning to minister the grace and compassion of Jesus to a broken nation. Silvers shows how it took only one man on Mount Carmel to set a nation on a new pathone faith-filled man who was willing to step out from the crowd and obey the Lord. Will there be one of these for America?" />
