  <title>Dare to Be Rare - Elle Bratland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dare to Be Rare is a spiritual roadmap that guides YOU to understand the importance your core beliefs are, affecting every aspect of your life. Dare to Be Rare guides you to take steps to change your beliefs and then live your life as you dream you can. 
If you are searching for an understanding of how God/Spirit relates to you in the here and now reality of todays world, reading Dare to Be Rare you can acquire new, self- rewarding beliefs about yourself and your relationship to Spirit. You dont have to be perfect to have an intimate relationship with Spirit. You already are having one and you always have, but you may not have known it if you harbored the old religious belief of God in the sky and little you and me, separate and powerless beings, down here.  As you read this book you will find surprising answers to your questions that can change your life for good.
I was drowning. Rev Elles course on meditation helped me stay afloat until I could be rescued.

The alleged cancer is gone.  Thanks for your counseling Rev. Elle.
Rev Elle, I signed a $180,000 HUD contract. Thank you for teaching me to believe in myself.
