  <title>The Transforming Believer - Zulibe Turner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I saw the Lord delivers me and my parents and brothers and sisters from death. Death came to our door to threaten our lives in the form of Rebels during the civil war in Sierra Leone. It came in the form of heavily armed insurgents dressed up in army uniforms holding guns and machine guns in army trucks never seen in my life by then. Disgust with evil and desperation to kill and to destroy they call aloud for all the occupants in our home to come out and shot rapidly at our gated fence in Sierra Leone. And soon we saw them one after the other jumped out their truck and violently thump the gate.
At the face of death when I imagine as already told by some of our friends of young girls that were already raped and brutally killed my heart fainted. The smell of death as horrible as it smell did not consumed us. With our last hope we cried out to the Lord and sort the face of God to deliver us from death and miraculously these people suddenly left our front gate without any of us been hurt. They shouted as they went we are coming back but I tell you this, the Lord never permitted them to come back. The lord rescued us. Also, lost in sea when all hopes disappeared, were the rumbling thunders and lightens stroke like consuming fire God became the captain and in the mist of hopelessness brought deliverance. The Lord has constantly and continuously been with me up to this hour in my life." />
