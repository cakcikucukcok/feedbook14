  <title>Turning Your Mess into a Message - Dr. Josef A. Howard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dr. Howard has crafted a careful and balanced blend of Bible exposition, theology, real-life illustrations from his vast ministerial experience, and practical applications to those who yearn for their lives to be transformed from a messy situation to a message that honors and glorifies God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each chapter expounds the miraculous way God used an unlikely individual with a messy life and turned his or her life into a positive message. The woman at the well, Zacchaeus, Jabez, Ruth, the thief on the cross, and Jephthah all faced challenging circumstances. Sin, genetics, the unexpected death of a spouse, rebellion, and poor family heritage placed these Bible characters in the most likely not to succeed category. All had three strikes against them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God, in His infinite mercy and grace, had a plan for each of these lives. He turned their mess into a positive message. Regardless of what mess you find your life to be in, this book gives practical ways of how to get out. Everyone faces trials and difficulties in life. Dr. Howard likens the trials and difficulties in life to potholes. Potholes appear out of nowhere  unexpectedly  and can be destructive and hurtful and take away our joy and sense of well being. Dr. Howard says, Being a Christian does not mean that we will not be faced with trials and tribulations, which are like potholes in our lives (some are big while others are small). Regardless of how messy your life is or how many potholes are causing you concern, &lt;i&gt;Turning Your Mess into a Message&lt;/i&gt; will give you hope and lead you to the Savior, who alone can turn your life around. He did it for the six Bible characters expounded upon in the book and He continues to change and transform messy lives into a message today. &lt;/p&gt;" />
