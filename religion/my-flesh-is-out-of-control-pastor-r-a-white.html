  <title>My Flesh Is out of Control - Pastor R.A. White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;My Flesh Is Out of Control was written to bring spiritual awareness so you can recognize the tricks of the enemy. It is as if some of us are in a minefield or in a place of destruction, not knowing that one bad step will cause you to commit spiritual suicide. Many of us are unaware of our surroundings, because we are blinded by our addictions and struggles. We feel that we have failed God and ourselves, and have allowed guilt and shame to drive us into a place of depression and low self-esteem. We have tried to control our environment and have become spiritually blind. Our sight has gone dim. The plan of the enemy is left undetected; we are not able to see him coming. The ability to focus and make clear decisions pertaining to our everyday lifeour ministries, health, finances, and how we govern our familyis now lost.&lt;/p&gt;" />
