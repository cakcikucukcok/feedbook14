  <title>The Calling of a Part-Time Pastor - Warren Seibert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;FROM THE FORWARD: The Calling of a Part-Time Pastor is written for all leaders of small churches. This guidebook is a gateway into fully understanding the trials and joys of working together to lead your small church to fulfill your calling in Jesus Christ. The insights you will discover on these pages will help you make the best decisions as you seek to call a part-time pastor to your church. So valuable is the guidance you will receive in this book that I urge your leaders to read it before looking for a minister, while the search is being conducted, and once again when the task is complete. If you use this book as a guide, you will find help in making the future ministry of your church the very best it can be.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This book is also for ministers considering a call to a small church. Here you will be reminded of what you already know-- that your ministry matters-- and that small churches matter in the kingdom of God. This book will resonate with what is in your heart and mind about Jesus Christ. The Calling of a Part-Time Pastor will elevate you in your calling, reminding you that your service and your church is holy and indispensable, and will serve as a valuable guide to effective and faithful part-time or bivocational ministry.&lt;/p&gt;" />
