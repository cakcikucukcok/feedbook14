  <title>Reach for the Praise - Rodney E. Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Did you know that you have something that God wants? He longs to receive it, he wants it so bad that he will move the sea for it. He wants it so bad that he will come from Heaven to earth for it. What is it you might ask; just what do I have that God wants bad enough to move in such a way. I am glad that you asked, it is your praise. Through this inspired book you will find out how valuable your praise is to God. You will learn practical ways to&lt;br&gt;
Praise past your persecutions&lt;br&gt;
Praise in the mist of the matter&lt;br&gt;
Praise while in the middle of the storm&lt;br&gt;
Praise while others stand idle&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Reach For The Praise will lift you to a new level of spirituality as well as praise and worship. It will show you the demonic attacks that have been launched against sacred music, as well as musicians, and worship leaders in the church. Since praise goes to the heights of heaven, it is important that we will reach high to perfect our praise. So come on and Reach For The Praise. Remember those that reach, will receive&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Every once in a while youll find someone that God has gifted in seemingly every area of life, Rodney E. Williams is one of these individuals. He is a pastor, musician and two time author. He has been a music minister for twenty five years. His many gifts has allowed him to frequent many different settings and cities. This gifting of preaching, playing, and singing has carried him across many denominational lines as well. Through out the years many sacred songs of Zion has been placed on the back shelf. Songs that were full of the gospel message, songs that were rich in giving God glory as well as praise; songs that seemingly that are lost forever. It is through this work that Pastor Williams desires to spark an interest in the hearts of every church member, musician, worship leader and pastor to Reach For The Praise. Pastor Williams resides in Sibley Louisiana with his wife Cynthia and their children. He presently serves as pastor of the King Solomon Baptist Church." />
