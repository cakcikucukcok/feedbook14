  <title>Broken Healer - Daniel, Miriam Pope</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You are not alone. Our story, like yours, is a story of the faithfulness of Jesus throughout the tapestry of our lives. From circumstances that seem so trivial that they go unnoticed to the devastating situations that shake our very existence, the one thing that we can know for certain is that faithful Jesus is always working and will never leave you or forsake you. Ours is a story where the doctors told us of the impossibilities, but through one miracle after another Jesus remained faithful to His Word. If you need to be encouraged, if you need hope restored, if you need a reminder of the faithfulness of Jesus in your life, this book was written for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broken Healer is an unusual autobiographywritten not in one voice, but two, giving the book a dual perspective that greatly enriches the story. Dans accident may have turned their world upside down, but Dan and Miriams faith in Jesus, their broken healer, is an inspiration to everyone who knows them. Their willingness to share the dark places of their brokenness with openness and honesty is to be admired and should be a source of encouragement to all who read this book.&lt;br /&gt;Gloria Kearney,author of Sing in the Shadow and Kingdom Park&lt;/p&gt;" />
