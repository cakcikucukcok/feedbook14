  <title>Mile Markers - Denise E. McKinney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;The journey of adolescence can be a long, winding road, filled with detours, wrong turns, great scenery, and amazing destinations. But for many teens, the journey can be overwhelming, intimidating, confusing, and can leave them feeling like they&amp;rsquo;re on the road alone. For youth workers and parents who want to help students along this journey, Mile Markers provides practical, easy-to-execute ideas that help create places to stop and reflect along the way. The included CD-ROM has 30+ practical activities perfect for sharing with parents and volunteers. Students will discover things about themselves and God that may be hard to recognize if they don&amp;rsquo;t slow down and savor some of the moments of their teenage years. After more than a decade in youth ministry, Denise McKinney discovered the key to her role and purpose in the lives of her students: creating mile markers&amp;mdash;or guideposts&amp;mdash;to help teens see where they&amp;rsquo;ve come from and where they&amp;rsquo;re going. &amp;ldquo;Mile Markers is the practice of leading students towards personal, tangible, and memorable moments that help shape the person they are becoming.&amp;rdquo; As a parent or youth worker, you have the privilege of walking alongside teens as they are on the road to discovering who they are and where they&amp;rsquo;re headed. You can encourage and affirm them as they begin to understand the answers to their questions of identity, purpose, and community, and you&amp;rsquo;ll guide them on their way to maturity.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
