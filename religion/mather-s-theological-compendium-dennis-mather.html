  <title>Mather’S Theological Compendium - Dennis Mather</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;These are exciting times to be living in. It is just before Jesus Christ returns to be the King of kings and Lord of lords. There are many signs that point to this, and I discuss a few of them in this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Im not going to tell you when this happens, because Jesus didn&#39;t know when he was here on earth. He said it was not for us to know. But Im sure He knows now, as He sits at the right hand of God the Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the ways we know that the time is near is that knowledge has increased dramatically in the last fifty years. Ultimately it all points to God as the creator of the universe.
We have the internet to dispense our knowledge, and it is pretty much worldwide. This is one of the ways that an imposter known as the Anti-Christ will take over a worldwide government that has been established and set up his own regime. Everyone will know this is their leader, because it will be broadcast by satellite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My advice is to read this book to decipher what the Bible says about these exciting times we are living in. As one of my favorite contemporary Christian music groups, Whiteheart, said in the title of one of their albums, Read the book, dont wait for the movie.&lt;/p&gt;" />
