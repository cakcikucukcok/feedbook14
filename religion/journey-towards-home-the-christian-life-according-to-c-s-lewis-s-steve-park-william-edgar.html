  <title>Journey Towards Home: The Christian Life According to C. S. Lewis - S. Steve Park, William Edgar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Clives Staples Lewis (1898-1963) called his theological writings as that &quot;of a layman and an amateur&quot; who merely attempted to restate &quot;ancient and orthodox doctrines.&quot; However, S. Steve Park argues that Lewis&#39;s theological reflections are well-informed, thoughtful and weighty. For instance, Lewis&#39;s notion of &quot;mere Christianity&quot; consistently shows his commitment to &quot;supernaturalism&quot; (vs. naturalism) and &quot;eucatastrophic salvationism&quot; (vs. ethical developmentalism) in sharp contrast to many prevailing theologians of his time.   In this book, the author expounded Lewis&#39;s theological writings rather comprehensively and organized the results according to Lewis&#39;s signature literary motif of the journey towards home, in four stages: &quot;Away from Home,&quot; &quot;Homeward Turning,&quot; &quot;Home Away from Home,&quot; and &quot;The Final Home.&quot; Under these headings, Lewis&#39;s major theological and literary themes find illuminating treatments with rich contents and penetrating analyses. In so doing, the author presents to the readers, probably for the first time, a systematic theology of C. S. Lewis. It turns out that Lewis, more than just a storyteller, was a significant participant in the world of theological reflections, demonstrating himself to be a rather formidable theological mind to be reckoned with." />
