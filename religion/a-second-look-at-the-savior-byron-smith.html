  <title>A Second Look at the Savior - Byron Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever seen yourself in the gallery of pictures presented to us in scripture? Maybe you see yourself as a Job pondering what Gods purpose is. A Jonah as he is given a mission he doesnt want. A Mary, unsure of the path before her but willing to be Gods instrument. This books purpose is to shed light on these questions that we bring before the throne of God. Many times the response is to move forward and walk on water. In these moments of our journey with Him we rejoice; feeling the excitement of Seeking and Finding a God who is dreaming with us. Other times we are presented with Be Still and Know lessons which cause many to stumble and question God as they feel swallowed up by the sea of life. This study dives into the heart of both areas. In doing so we will enter a much broader topic of pain and suffering, where Gods silence and His answers meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Second Look at the Savior is a thoughtful and inspiring testimony. Byron walks us through Scripture and his own personal faith journey. He leads us on a quest to recognize Gods calling to live a life of faith in the darkness. He reminds us powerfully that God can be trusted in our most vulnerable moments.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Dr. Mike Williams, President Faulkner University&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Byron Smith has worked in several ministries over the last twenty years. After receiving his BA in biblical studies through Faulkner University, he has served as youth minister, inner city evangelist, and presently the director of Gulf Coast Bible Camp. Throughout all these works, he has been tied to the youth primarily and credits each and every one of them for helping him to keep a cool mind, sharp wit, and sense of humor! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Second Look at the Savior is the first installment in a new series. This book takes the reader down a path of discovery as we look at how God continues to shape us in His likeness. No matter where we are on our individual walks with Him, lessons are being presented. I pray this book is an encouragement to you on your journey.
