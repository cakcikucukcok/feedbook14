  <title>Biblical Principles for Life Diversities - Rev. Dr. Derrick A. Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This particular book will be controversy to some to others be a break through to others be a reference but for me was a gift from God to be apart of. As I gave my self unto God to be use to edify the body of Christ as well as receive the fullness of Gods spirit in my writing as I wrote this particular material. This will cover a lot of information that is very pertinent to the growing of the individual spiritual awakening in ones life. With the gathering of the information will reveal a revelation that will impregnate you to birth the revelation in the physical that will produce fruit to call upon others to come in from the storm. God placed an ultimate call upon each of the members of the body of Christ and we have to be willing to open ourselves to the revelation to reach the calling.
  We will look at here several areas that will enlighten as well as break shackles that has hinder us from growing in the spirit. I want you to know that mans interpretation distort Gods revelation and that is an attack method that has been killing us for thousands of years. We will together contemplate the mysterious of the word of God and unlock the doors to revelation to be able to add power to our walk in Christ Jesus. We will be breaking passed down religion from our mothers and grandmothers and fathers and grandfathers and take a close examination of the word of God. This will reveal unto us our hidden agenda as well as the deep penetration of the enemy in our lives.
 We will look at Character Defects, as well as Blessings, and What is the Body of Christ, and Method of Attack from the enemy as well as defensive measures for us. We will take a deep look within the true essence of the word of God and seek out the principle that will set us free from the devices used by the enemy. We will also look at Sin and Lust which in those sections will reveal some hidden keys that will unlock some false embedded information that our foundation was build on and that is slowly destroying the righteous part of the foundation. So I know that this particular book will be a blessing to you as well as it was to me so I look forward to interacting with you on another elevation in the body of Christ Jesus. As we grow together we gain strength so together we are a strong front of an unbreakable force to be a mighty army of God. Remember we seek revelation not interpretation of Gods word. God bless and enjoy." />
