  <title>Wisdom from Pope Paul VI - Mary Leonora Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With amazing courage Pope Paul VI faced hardship in his papacy and held steadfast to hope, leading the Church through some of the most turbulent times in recent history. This precious keepsake book underlines his faith, his strength of character in following God&#39;s will, and his steady leadership during a formative time for the Church.Compiled on the occasion of his canonization, this pocket-size volume provides readers with an introduction to this often-misunderstood pope whose words and actions have proven to be bold and prophetic for those who wish to follow the way of the Lord. Taken from a wide array of his talks with people from around the world, they highlight what it means to be a disciple today.The compiler, Mary Leonora Wilson, FSP, entered the Daughters of St. Paul on the same day Pope Paul VI was crowned as pontiff. Her special connection and love for the saint is evident in the care taken to choose those words of the holy father&#39;s that would most inspire all those who seek God, especially those who face darkness, fear, or seemingly insurmountable odds. With themes on the cross, courage, joy, Mary as Mother, and the Eucharist, readers will be delighted to discover a wealth of wisdom for their own path today. The book also includes a wonderful collection of prayers from the new saint, as well as original prayers from the compiler paired with each meditation, and a brief contemporary biography." />
