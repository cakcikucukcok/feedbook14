  <title>A Depth of Insight - James A. Eldred</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Personally compelling and relevant to every Christian life, James Eldreds A Depth of Insight is a treasure trove of simple but powerful truths regarding what it is to be a disciple of Jesus Christ. Exploring that which effectively defends the faith and the one thing in your life that shows the whole world that you serve Jesus, this book sheds light on the reality of our individual relationships with our Savior. Each nugget of wisdom is set in the context of actual events with real people as they go about life. Every chapter brings to life how the power of God has worked to change the nature and character of one of His disciples. Each new story tells how the Holy Spirit used Scripture, other believers, and every aspect of life to transform the author.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you struggle with stress or debilitating health issues? Do you not hear from God no matter how hard you pursue Him? Do you lack joy and fulfillment, or struggle with family and relationships? No matter how much you have, does it seem inadequate or unsatisfying? Eldred lays bare these issues and many more in A Depth of Insight.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If just one of these concepts speaks to your life, you can be impacted by Gods wisdom as it is presented in this book.&lt;p&gt;" />
