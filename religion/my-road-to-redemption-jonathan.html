  <title>My Road to Redemption - Jonathan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is more than just a reflection on my life, I recognized that many people are struggling with the same burning questions and are making the same mistakes in their lives as what I did. I needed to find out what my purpose on earth was, why I have been unhappy for many years, The idea came to write this book, maybe, I could help somebody discover themselves the way I have and understand that I have already paid for my mistakes, no need to make the same mistakes again, If this book can help to turn just one to God with love, then all was worth it for me. I truly discovered what I have been missing all my life and the fool I have become. I discovered happiness, acceptance and true peace and attempts to show the way here. This is not a quick fix it book, however, if my words resonates in your heart, you will follow the word of God because you want to and come to understand your purpose on this earth. The story includes the future of South Africa, although Britain and America is just mentioned in passing, their respective futures are the same." />
