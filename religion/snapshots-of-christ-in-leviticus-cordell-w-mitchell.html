  <title>Snapshots of Christ in Leviticus - Cordell W. Mitchell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book will turn on a bright light as you see Leviticus with Christ at its center. If you are a pastor, teacher, or preacher, hundreds of diamonds await you to pick up and expound on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the young ministers in third world countries, this book was written specifically for you to open your eyes to the seed truths in Leviticus of Christ and their fulfillments in the New Testament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greater knowledge you have of the Scriptures, the greater will you see in these snapshots. The author assumes your knowledge is wide and has made the subject quick and to the point, awaiting only your hand to expound on it for your hearers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You hold in your hand much of the results of my quest in searching for Christ in the Scriptures; His snapshots are in every book of the Bible, waiting for you to behold His face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself. (Luke 24:27)&lt;/p&gt;" />
