  <title>Words from the Master&#39;s Collection - Vickie Campbell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book contains praise, testimonies, and revelation knowledge. Most of the writings discuss different situations, which happened in my life. The remaining divisions are written through God given insight. He longs to reveal mysteries to each persons understanding. Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints. To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. (Colossians 1:26-27)
The directions to eternal life can be found in this book. I asked Jesus to demonstrate His mighty power through the breathtaking actions He gave me to do. Gods love, mercy, and amazing grace are within each section. This book contains biblical truths that profoundly provide evidence, which proves Jesus Christ is the only sure foundation to eternal life. St. John 3:16 declare, For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believe in him would not perish but, have everlasting life. As an outcome to His powerful and errorless Word, mingling inside of each chapter, it will be very effective in the spiritual and natural realm. 
People who feel discouraged and sincerely do not know what to do should read this book. Individuals that believe they are alone in a confused and apprehensive world will find hope in these true stories. The Lord wants every person to feel secure and have high expectations in His faithfulness. Gods wisdom, peace, and so many other things are revealed in this manuscript.
For many years I asked Jesus to prepare peoples hearts to receive the writings He led me to compose. At this time my prayer is for Him to make those words burn inside of each sinners and born again believers hearts, which reads or hears about them. Through Gods grace the unsaved will be totally delivered from their sinful way of living. The born again are going to be set free from bondages and supernaturally blessed by His mighty power. They will be a part of an incalculable number of people that is going to be given to Him as a conclusion to the end of His long suffering. This is the Lords doing and it is marvelous in my eyes!" />
