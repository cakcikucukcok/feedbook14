  <title>Scriptural Lessons from the Civil War - Don Kienholz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If you are one of the many Americans fascinated by the American Civil War, but feel that there is nothing new under the sun concerning that epic time, think again. In these pages you will find a wealth of stories of incredible courage, extraordinary perseverance, and heartwarming affection and humor. These stories of the personalities and events from the Civil War are carefully chosen to appeal to both the well-acquainted as well as the novice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book includes spiritual lessons for us today, using practical applications and insights from the Holy Scriptures, based on intriguing stories of those who lived through our nations greatest trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hope is that these stories, written in a highly readable, short-chapter devotional style, will not only provide Civil War lovers with hours of reading enjoyment but wisdom and hope in the midst of our own trials each of us face in these difficult times.&lt;/p&gt;" />
