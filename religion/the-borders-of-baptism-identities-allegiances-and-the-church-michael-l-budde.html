  <title>The Borders of Baptism: Identities, Allegiances, and the Church - Michael L. Budde</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It&#39;s a simple claim, really - that for Christians, being a Christian should be their primary allegiance and identity. For those who proclaim Jesus as Lord, this identity should supersede all others, and this loyalty should trump all lesser ones. It may be a simple claim, but it is a controversial one for many people, Christians and non-Christians alike.  	The Borders of Baptism uses the idea of solidarity among Christians as a lens through which to view politics, economics, and culture. It offers Christians a fresh perspective capable of moving beyond sterile and dead-end debates typical of debates on issues ranging from immigration and race to war, peace, and globalization.  	The Borders of Baptism invites Christians of all traditions to reflect on the theological and political implications of first being a Christian in a world of rival loyalties. It invites readers to see what it might mean to be members of a community broader than the largest nation-state; more pluralistic than any culture in the world; more deeply rooted in the lives of the poor and marginalized than any revolutionary movement; and more capable of exemplifying the notion of ;e pluribus unum&#39; than any empire past, present, or future." />
