      <meta name="description" content="In the summer of Molly&#39;s fifteenth year, a speedboat landed on her head. She suffered a horrendously severe brain injury and experienced a miraculous and unprecedented survival. She woke up to the realization that she had to relearn everything, and she had the next three tenuous, painful years to figure out how far she would recover. That was high school.  During those three years, she would have given anything to talk to someone who had undergone a similar recovery and who had come out the other side. This book is the story that she wanted to read.
