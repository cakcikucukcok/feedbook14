  <title>The Book of Genesis - Beginnings - Kenneth B. Alexander, Sherry Mobley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Genesis is the Book of beginnings. That God (YHWH common name Elohim) is the primary creator is apparent throughout the book. YHWH is the true name of God however the Jews were not permitted to say God&amp;#39;s true name so they used Elohim as a substitute.  He created the Heavens and the earth and all plant and animal life that was to populate the planet. He created man and created a special nation for Himself called. Israel. Israel means &amp;quot;struggle with God&amp;quot; named after Jacob wrestling with God all night at the river Jabbok. The nation continued to struggle with God throughout its existence as a nation. Eventually God became frustrated with their lack of obedience and had physical Israel conquered. Today the true Israel is a spiritual Israel composed of those who accept Christ as their Savior by faith. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Genesis we see some of the most important developments in the foundation of the Israelite nation, which is the foundation for everything that was to come later. We have seen Christ and His role as the logos, the word of the Father. We have seen that He existed with the Father from the beginning as a principal part of the Great Trinity. It was no different when he appeared on earth as the Son of God. While here, He was the representation and mouthpiece of the Father. &amp;quot;Have I been so long with you, and yet you have not come to know Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how can you say, &amp;#39;Show us the Father&amp;#39;? &amp;quot;Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on My own initiative, but the Father abiding in Me does His works&amp;quot; (John 14:9-10). Jesus was the exact representation of the Father and He only spoke and did what was revealed to Him by the Father. As John said: &amp;quot;All things came into being through Him, [Christ] and apart from Him nothing came into being that has come into being&amp;quot; (John 1:1-3). On earth it was the Father working through the Son. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Father was the Creator of the heavens and the earth, but it was given Christ to speak it into existence by the word. Even now the Father has given the Son (Christ) all authority in heaven and earth. As Christ said in His parting words: &amp;quot;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth&amp;quot; (Matthew 28:18). The Father had this plan in mind from before the world was created. &amp;quot;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed US with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ, just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before Him. In love He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will,&amp;quot; (Ephesians 1:3-5).  And: &amp;quot;For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to BECOME CONFORMED TO THE IMAGE OF HIS SON, so that He would be the firstborn among many brethren; and these whom He  predestined, He also called; and these whom He called, He also justified; and these whom He justified, He also glorified&amp;quot; (Romans 8:29-30). Finally: &amp;quot;Yet we do speak wisdom among those who are mature; a wisdom, however, not of this age nor of the rulers of this age, who are  passing away;  but we speak God&amp;#39;s wisdom in a mystery, the hidden wisdom which God  predestined before the ages to our glory; the wisdom which none of the rulers of this age has understood; for if they had understood it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory; but just as it is written, &amp;quot;THINGS WHICH EYE HAS NOT SEEN AND EAR HAS NOT HEARD, AND which HAVE NOT ENTERED THE HEART OF MAN, ALL THAT GOD HAS PREPARED FOR THOSE WHO LOVE HIM&amp;quot; (1 Corinthians 2:6-9; Isaiah 64:4).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The process of creation gave birth to the creative Word of God which would be used by prophets in creating what was to come in the process leading to Christ.
