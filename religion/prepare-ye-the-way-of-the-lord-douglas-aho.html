  <title>Prepare Ye the Way of the Lord! - Douglas Aho</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Father deported Satan from heaven to the Garden of Eden, to cleanse heaven of sin and give him limited rights to chastise all soul descendants of Adam. Because of Adams sin, all souls host Satans counsel leading to death of the flesh and spirit. Only the Chosen are provided Holy Spirit counsel to stay the execution of spirit death pending approval to access the cross. The purpose of the Fathers Will allows false doctrine to permeate many of todays denominations. Non acceptance of the Fathers total sovereignty results in the rejection of the Fathers Total Will power. Replication of Satans opposition sin in heaven will not be tolerated in His Chosen. Qualifying for salvation is a serious business requiring a comprehensive Spirit assessment of works righteousness that bring glory to the Father. Testing will put the Chosens spirit under stress while being counseled by Satan and the Spirit. The Spirit will judge responses to both counsels as to the glory received by the Father, for access to the cross.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The Fathers Will provides a screening environment for His chosen, allowing comparison of false doctrine with Spirit led doctrine. When the author started engaging the Spirit, the bible came alive with Spirit led revelations. These revelations completely destroy Prosperity Theologys Book of Life and Chosen doctrines. They provide a complete mosaic of the Fathers salvation plan, from the soul pool to completion of the Great White Throne Judgment. This book is an epistle to the Chosen allowing access to biblical truth, that provides the full armor of God for Jesus great commission commandment.&lt;/p&gt;" />
