  <title>Healing Beyond Counseling - Gary Heese</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Healing Beyond Counseling is a systematic approach to Spiritual and Emotional healing dependent on the help of the Holy Spirit and the Power of the cross. Healing Beyond Counseling includes the application or appropriation of the power of the cross for yourself and others. This book is designed to not only to lead seekers to a place of healing in their lives. It is also a tool to train pastors and lay leaders to be more effective in ministry. When Interns and leaders in our church ask about this ministry, I tell each one the same thing. If you are interested in being in ministry you may as well know how to do ministry. The members in your church you are close to will come to you for help. Are you equipped to help them?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;To those seeking help, because of what Jesus did on the cross for you, where you came from is not who you have to be. That is Redemption! Our hope for you through this journey of healing is you will enter into a state of healing so you may come into a greater revelation of God as your father. When you know Him in this way you will be more secure and know your true worth.&lt;/p&gt;
