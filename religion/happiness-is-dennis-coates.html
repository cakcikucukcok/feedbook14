  <title>Happiness Is - Dennis Coates</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Happiness. What is it? Why is it so central to man&amp;rsquo;s being? Why is its pursuit central to man&amp;rsquo;s activity on earth? Does God have anything to say about happiness? Does God have anything to do with man&amp;rsquo;s happiness? Can we bring about our own happiness? Can we destroy our own happiness? Would anyone deliberately set out to be unhappy? Would unhappiness ever be our goal in life?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; So begins &lt;em&gt;Happiness Is&lt;/em&gt; by Dennis Coates, author of Walk with Me. Dennis contends that happiness is of the very nature of human life, that happiness is its purpose, and that happiness is meant to be permanent in life, both now and in the hereafter. Furthermore, Dennis contends that happiness has its origin in God Himself who made us in His image. This has importance in the very meaning of happiness and how we obtain it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Look into &lt;em&gt;Happiness Is&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;it could change your life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
