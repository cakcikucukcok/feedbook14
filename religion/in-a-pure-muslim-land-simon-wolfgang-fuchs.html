  <title>In a Pure Muslim Land - Simon Wolfgang Fuchs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Centering Pakistan in a story of transnational Islam stretching from South Asia to the Middle East, Simon Wolfgang Fuchs offers the first in-depth ethnographic history of the intellectual production of Shi&amp;&lt;/i&gt;703;is and their religious competitors in this &quot;Land of the Pure.&quot; The notion of Pakistan as the pinnacle of modern global Muslim aspiration forms a crucial component of this story. It has empowered Shi&amp;&lt;/i&gt;703;is, who form about 20 percent of the country&#39;s population, to advance alternative conceptions of their religious hierarchy while claiming the support of towering grand ayatollahs in Iran and Iraq. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fuchs shows how popular Pakistani preachers and scholars have boldly tapped into the esoteric potential of Shi&amp;&lt;/i&gt;703;ism, occupying a creative and at times disruptive role as brokers, translators, and self-confident pioneers of contemporary Islamic thought.&amp;nbsp;They have indigenized the Iranian Revolution and formulated their own ideas for fulfilling the original promise of Pakistan. Challenging typical views of Pakistan as a mere Shi&amp;&lt;/i&gt;703;i backwater, Fuchs argues that its complex religious landscape represents how a local, South Asian Islam may open up space for new intellectual contributions to global Islam. Yet religious ideology has also turned Pakistan into a deadly battlefield: sectarian groups since the 1980s have been bent on excluding Shi&amp;&lt;/i&gt;703;is as harmful to their own vision of an exemplary Islamic state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
