  <title>Glimpses of Heaven:  Lessons on Faith and Hope, Love and Joy - Volume One - Roela Victoria Rivera</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A diaconal minister, author, and creative artist, Roela Victoria Rivera became legally blind in 2004, two years after she had severe illness that left her in a coma for three days and led her to a near-death experience (NDE) which allowed her to see the glory and beauty of heaven. While undergoing eight eye surgeries over a period of eight years, she felt her faith and trust fading away for awhile.  However, her deep faith in GOD and fervent prayers have strengthened her belief that GOD has never left her side and is leading her each day with new meaningful plan and purpose for her life. GOD has blessed Roela to see glimpses of heave at three points in her life: when she was ten years old, at age eighteen, and in mid-life which guided her with wisdom and strength, courage and creative power to write this inspirational book with divine guidance from GOD, holy light from Jesus, and inspiration from the Holy Spirit.  She will help you see glimpses of heave in many different ways in everyday life.  She also wishes to share her creative artworks and the great Lessons of Life she learned from her heavenly visions and from the Scripture.  She continues her ministry for GODs glory through her GraceNotes Creative Ministry and inspirational items she designs to share GODs Words of love and grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roelas physical and spiritual journey is an inspiration to everyone who reads about it in this book.  We hope you find it so.&lt;/p&gt;" />
