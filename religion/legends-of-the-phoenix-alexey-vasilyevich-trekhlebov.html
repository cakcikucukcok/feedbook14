  <title>Legends of the Phoenix - Alexey Vasilyevich Trekhlebov</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dear reader, if you are holding in your hands the book Legends of the Phoenix by A.V.Trehlebov, then in just a moment a magnificent journey awaits you filled with fascinating knowledge about the hidden history of our world and some of the most fascinating societal processes to ever occur. If you have already read a few dozen books on the subject but are still asking yourself the questions &quot;Who am i?&quot; &quot;What is my purpose here?&quot; or &quot;Why do we die?&quot; then this book will become a treasure within your library. 
If you are still searching for the answers to the age old questions of the origins of life on earth, the origins and evolution of our modern civilization, the origins of different races, the true history of the people on earth, our spiritual growth as humans, or the universal laws of the universe, then this book has come to you at the right time.  
Through years of scientific study, this non-fiction tractate is written in a simple yet fascinating manner and is suitable for all readers. 
The phoenix, as in the title of the book, is an ancient Russian symbol symbolizing the rebirth of Russia and the Slavic people. From folk tales it is written that these birds rise from their ashes, are then reborn in a magical flame and appear in a purer form. Since history has always been written by, and for the benefit of the current rulers, disregarding any previous facts or knowledge, we use the experience and heritage of our ancestors which have been laid out in the &quot;Legends of the Phoenix.&quot; 
Legends of the Phoenix is devoted to the revival of the ancient, million year old culture and heritage of the Slavic people. The information in this book has deep roots from the Slavic Vedas dating back hundreds of thousands of years with knowledge not yet fully discovered by our modern civilization.
Consisting of two parts, the first part Origin of the Slavic-Aryans discusses the root origins of the Slavic people, the ancient texts and archaeological monuments, the eon old Slavic ancestry, our beliefs, morals, commandments, and the answers to the mysterious wise tales of the Slavs. The second part called &quot;The Path to Light&quot; discusses the connection and meaning of the Slavic and Hindu Vedas, the stages of the ancient Slavic spiritual belief &quot;Rodoveriye&quot;, the meaning of spiritual development, the paths and goals of our ancient societies, the wisdom behind each stage of life and how to get ready for and create virtuous offspring, the nature of divine and demonic entities and their purpose, the importance of understanding your inner self and past lives, the structure of all our energy bodies, the origins of the Vedas, what it means to have a non-dualistic view of the universe, and the secrets of the Golden Path." />
