  <title>S.O.F.T. - Kathleen Zacca</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When the storms come, what do you do? When the pain is unbearable, how do you survive? The answer is faithfaith that God loves you and cares for you, no matter what the outcome is. You must have faith that God will do what is best for you and the ones you are praying for. Faith even when you see the opposite of what you are praying for. Faith that God has a plan for you and the ones you love. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are deep down in a nasty pit and there seems to be no way out, it is time for you to take a stand and live the life God has designed specifically for you. The battle will be fierce, but you can do it! How do you get out of that pit? Faithunquestioning belief in God. Faith is the key that unlocks all the answers to your questions.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;God loves you like no other, and he wants you to understand what your faith means to him. This world and your heavenly Father need you and your faith. It is time for you to get up and fight. It is time for you to take a stand and defeat the enemy. We must unite and stand on faith together to experience victory after victory for his glory! 
If you are ready, I only have one question: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Will you stand with me?&lt;/p&gt;" />
