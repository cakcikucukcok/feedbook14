  <title>Cultural Enslavement: Breaking Free into Abundant Living - David Wenell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Abundant life. Who doesn&#39;t want to live life to the fullest? Jesus offers us life to the fullest, but few of us feel we have attained it. Jesus calls us to be in the world, but not of it, because we have been made citizens of God&#39;s Kingdom. Too often, however, we get too drawn into the world&#39;s ways. Often our culture can enslave us.  Cultural Enslavement: Breaking Free into Abundant Living takes a look at ways we become captives of our culture as well as ways to break free of them. Abundant living is Christ&#39;s desire for all who follow Him. Discover how to throw off the shackles that hold you back and how to experience life more fully." />
