  <title>My Life and Spiritual Growth as a Military Spouse - Martha E. H. Franklin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I grew up in Pensacolatruly a beach girl, spending many days at Pensacola beach with family. As a little girl, I always wished for more and dreamed big. I refer to it as riding the waves of life. I believe in myself, Im my own biggest fan and have no intention of ever giving up on my vision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I share the benefit of my personal development and gained wisdom, even during my darkest days. Standing in the light now is a blessing and a gift from God. I embrace this higher power every day. No one knows where their journey ultimately ends but I do know it begins with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have four sisters but I am one of two daughters born to Creola and Wiley Hickenbotham. Even though my mother became a single parent, after the separation, we grew up in a spiritual home. When my mother was well she took great care of each one of us. I can remember how close we were while living in Pensacola Village, low income housing, and in my eyes, this was the best place to live where I had great friends. In spite of my early beginnings, I learned that you make the best with what you have been given in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have opened up to the world and want you to know that you are not alone. Whatever you are going through in life I believe you will come out on top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May God bless you,&lt;/p&gt;
