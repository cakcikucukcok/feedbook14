  <title>Surviving Toxic Leaders: How to Work for Flawed People in Churches, Schools, and Christian Organizations - Kenneth O. Gangel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Since Jean Lipman-Blumen&#39;s The Allure of Toxic Leaders shook the corporate world in 2005, countless articles, books, and Internet blogs have appeared on the topic.  Despite such interest and response, no study of toxic leadership had appeared from a Christian point of view until this volume, Kenn Gangel&#39;s Surviving Toxic Leaders.   Gangel begins by showing that toxic leadership existed throughout biblical history. Making generous use not only of biblical materials but also of contemporary leadership literature, Gangel names the causes and cures of power abuse, cheating, bullying, laziness, and dictatorial behavior in today&#39;s leaders.  Readers will benefit from Gangel&#39;s leadership experience and expertise. He has been a pastor, a college dean (twice), and a college president. Gangel currently edits The Seal, a review of leadership literature.   Practical and personal, Surviving Toxic Leaders abounds with stories of real people and their situations. Everyone who has ever had &quot;trouble at work&quot; will benefit from Surviving Toxic Leaders." />
