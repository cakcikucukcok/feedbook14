  <title>Miles Past Normal: Principles for the Journey - Tim Cooper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At each turn in life we are bombarded with the idea of normal. Normal finds a job he hates so it can pay for things he doesn&#39;t need while he wishes he was doing something else. Normal believes that creativity, imagination, innovation, and dreaming should cease after the fifth grade. Normal goes to church for an hour on Sundays but doesn&#39;t get carried away or allow her faith to truly intersect her life any other time of the week. Each day of normal becomes a tedious, hard-pill to swallow. But each day of normal also swells our thirst for something more. Have you ever wondered if there was something beyond normal? Have you ever craved adventure? What about purpose? Wished for meaning? Longed to know that what you do really matters? Maybe you&#39;ve just longed to know that you matter. What if you could unlock the secrets to an abnormal life just like those men and women in Hebrews 11? What if God&#39;s design for your life is so much more than the trappings of this world? What if there is a life up ahead that could be meaningful, adventurous, and most of all, matter for eternity? What if God is not done altering the course of history? This is your invitation to travel miles past normal." />
