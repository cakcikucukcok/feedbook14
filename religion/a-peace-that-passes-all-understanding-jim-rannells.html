  <title>A Peace That Passes All Understanding - Jim Rannells</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As Christians, we know that God is in control and that it is through Christ that we find both salvation and peace. Yet the world is still full of trials and tribulations, and there are many ways in which we can be robbed of this peace. So when facing the darkness, where do we turn to find the light? How can we preserve the peace that passes all understanding?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Peace That Passes All Understanding, author Jim Rannells shares the heartbreaking story of his sons suicide and the sickness and deep horror and grief that followed. Yet from his tragedy he would find the peace that passes all understanding, and his trust in God would become solidified in faith. With a more complete spiritual view, Jim shows how the horror of his loss contains so much deep joy and peacebecause Christ with outstretched arms is standing in that picture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter what life throws at you, and no matter the losses you incur, Christ is always ready to meet your needs and provide you with hope, peace, and even joy. Even in the darkest times, lasting peace through Christ is achievable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true that time stands still for significant moments in our lives. A second can seem to last an eternity when, from one monumental experience, a torrent of separate emotions comes into our minds. I do not think I could fully describe what a pistol to the head does when it is fired, with the traumatic carnage from a bullet entering and leaving the skullcoupled with the fact that this was my own flesh and blood who was sitting there on his bed. I dont think there was a single negative human emotion absent in me in that very moment, including a violent, physical revulsion. My picture in my mind that morning was one of physical sickness and deep horror, and certainly the ugliness of death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, with a more completed, spiritual view, that picture includes so much deep joy and peace, because Christ with outstretched arms is standing in that picture. This story has a happy, joyful ending, so I encourage the reader to read on. From my tragedy, I found the peace that passes all understanding, and my trust in God is more solid. It is my deep desire to continue to learn of Him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
