  <title>We Are at War - Vitalis Chi Nwaneri</title>
      <meta name="description" content="VITALIS CHIDOMERE NWANERI, brings to these five Books, his experience in Religion, Economics, Politics, Science, Philosophy and exposure in various advanced and developing countries across the globe. He acquired his experience from the Graduate School of The London School of Economics and Political Science, University of London (1962-1968). He joined the United Kingdom Government after his graduation and quickly rose to the position of an Economic Adviser. He left the Government in 1971 to join the World Bank in Washington D.C. U.S.A. He worked there till 1980 and rose to the position of a Senior Economist (1980). At the World Bank, he traveled extensively across the globe and gained exposure and firsthand experience on some of the major Political, Economic and Social Development problems across the globe. In some of his economic and political analyses in the World Bank , he confronted some of these Economic , Political , Religious and Philosophical issues in some countries in Asia, Middle East , Africa including such countries as Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Iran , Tunisia and Libya where he worked. Therefore he was not surprised with the on-going crises and wars in these countries because of his concerns over their lack of Christian pillars of modern civilization, democracy, and governance. His experience and exposure had inspired his analyses in these four books. &lt;br&gt; 
Back in Nigeria in 1980, he became one of the countrys pioneers in Indigenous Banking and the Establishment of the First African Commodity Exchange. During his twenty years in Nigeria (1980-2000), he embarked on the audacious mission of bringing his global exposure and experience to contribute to the development of Nigerias Finance and Private sectors to lead its National Development. His Book on MISSION 2000 highlights his audacious dream for Nigerias Private sector to lead the Countrys emergence in the global world of the new century. The Book also reflected the views he promoted while working as a Consultant for the Nigeria Government, The World Bank , African Development Bank and The U.S.A.I.D. His pioneering projects in Nigerias Banking and Trade sectors exposed him to the weakness of Nigerias Politics and Governance. So he decided to take a shot at Nigerian Politics. &lt;br&gt;" />
