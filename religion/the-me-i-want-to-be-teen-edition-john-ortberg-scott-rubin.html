  <title>The Me I Want to Be, Teen Edition - John Ortberg, Scott Rubin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Me I Want to Be by John Ortberg&amp;mdash;the bestselling author of When the Game Is Over, It All Goes Back in the Box; God Is Closer Than You Think; and The Life You&amp;rsquo;ve Always Wanted&amp;mdash;will help you discover spiritual vitality like never before as you learn to &amp;ldquo;live in the flow of the spirit.&amp;rdquo; But if God has a perfect vision for your life, why does spiritual growth seem so difficult? John Ortberg has some intriguing answers to that question, and he has organized his thoughts and God&#39;s words into a straightforward and timely guide for living your best life in The Me I Want to Be. This book will show how God&#39;s perfect vision for you starts with a powerful promise. All those who trust in God &quot;will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its roots by the stream. It does not fear when heat comes; its leaves are always green. It has no worries in a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit&quot; (Jeremiah 17:7-8). Ortberg urges you to recognize your brokenness, understand that God is the project manager, and follow His directions. The author first helps gauge your spiritual health and measure the gap between where you are now and where God intends you to be. Then he provides detailed tasks and exercises to help you live in the flow of the Spirit, circumventing real-world barriers&amp;mdash;pain and sorrow, temptations, self-doubt, sin&amp;mdash;to flourish even in a dark and broken world. As you start living in the flow, you will feel: &amp;mdash; a deeper connection with God &amp;mdash; a growing sense of joy &amp;mdash; an honest recognition of your brokenness &amp;mdash; less fear, more trust &amp;mdash; a growing sense of being &amp;ldquo;rooted in love&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; a deeper sense of purpose God invites you to join Him in crafting an abundant and joy-filled life. The Me I Want to Be shows you how to graciously accept His invitation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
