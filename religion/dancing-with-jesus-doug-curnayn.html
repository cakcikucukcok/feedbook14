  <title>Dancing with Jesus - Doug Curnayn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book explores subjects like faith, works, politics, evolution, creation, racism, abortion, sexual, drug, and alcohol addiction, charismatic and traditional beliefs, miracles, why believe the Bible, does God exist, the carnal man, the Christian man, the rise of militant homosexuals, what was the Beginning, and does God send people to hell who don&#39;t have Jesus in their heart even if they never heard of Him? &quot;Dancing with Jesus&quot; by Doug Curnayn will show you new ways of thinking that you may not have considered before.  It just may cause you to realize that youre not a real Christian, but only a religious person who thinks you are one. It could show you the way to the salvation of your eternal soul.  You owe it to yourself to check it out. Don&#39;t pretend your way to hell. Be sure of your salvation. It&#39;s the most important thing you will ever do.  Even if you don&#39;t need this book, go ahead and buy it, and give it to someone who does need it." />
