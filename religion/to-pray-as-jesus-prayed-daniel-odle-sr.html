  <title>To Pray as Jesus Prayed - Daniel Odle  Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Most people have much experience in praying to God, but far fewer hear the Father speaking to them in the way that Jesus heard the Father. Clearly people would pray much more if their spiritual communication was to the extent that they talk with one another in the natural sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To Pray as Jesus Prayed&lt;/em&gt; addresses this obscurity with clear Bible teaching. For example, you will learn&lt;/p&gt;
how God communicates His voice;
why some do not hear Gods voice;
which images release Gods voice in your life;
how to be established in prayer by the Lord when you hear His voice;
how to overcome the groping so common in prayer life.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To Pray as Jesus Prayed&lt;/em&gt; shows you what matters most is not what you say to God, but what God says to you. You can obtain rich fellowship with the Father when His disposition, His attitude, and His true involvement is realized in prayer.&lt;/p&gt;" />
