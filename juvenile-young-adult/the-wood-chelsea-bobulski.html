  <title>The Wood - Chelsea Bobulski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An enchanted wood poisoned at the roots. A girl bound by an inherited duty. And the lost traveler from another time who might help her uncover the truth. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; From debut author Chelsea Bobulski comes &lt;i&gt;The Wood&lt;/i&gt;, a YA novel filled with dark mystery and atmospheric fantasy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Winter didn&#39;t ask to be the guardian of the wood, but when her dad inexplicably vanishes, she&#39;s the one who must protect travelers who accidentally slip through the wood&#39;s portals. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The wood is poisoned, changing into something more sinister. Once brightly colored leaves are now bubbling inky black. Vicious creatures that live in the shadows are becoming bolder, torturing lost travelers. Winter must now put her trust in Henry--a young man from eighteenth century England who knows more than he should about the wood--in order to find the truth and those they&#39;ve lost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Bobulski&#39;s beautiful and eerie young adult debut, is a haunting tale of friendship, family, and the responsibilities we choose and those we do not.&lt;/p&gt;" />
