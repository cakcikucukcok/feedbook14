  <title>Masterpiece - Elise Broach, Kelly Murphy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Marvin lives with his family under the kitchen sink in the Pompadays&#39; apartment. He is very much a beetle. James Pompaday lives with his family in New York City. He is very much an eleven-year-old boy.After James gets a pen-and-ink set for his birthday, Marvin surprises him by creating an elaborate miniature drawing. James gets all the credit for the picture and before these unlikely friends know it they are caught up in a staged art heist at the Metropolitan Museum of Art that could help recover a famous drawing by Albrecht Dürer. But James can&#39;t go through with the plan without Marvin&#39;s help. And that&#39;s where things get really complicated (and interesting!). This fast-paced mystery will have young readers on the edge of their seats as they root for boy and beetle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Shakespeare&#39;s Secret &lt;/i&gt;Elise Broach showed her keen ability to weave storytelling with history and suspense, and &lt;i&gt;Masterpiece &lt;/i&gt;is yet another example of her talent. This time around it&#39;s an irresistible miniature world, fascinating art history, all wrapped up in a special friendship-- something for everyone to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Masterpiece&lt;/i&gt; is a 2009 Bank Street - Best Children&#39;s Book of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;" />
