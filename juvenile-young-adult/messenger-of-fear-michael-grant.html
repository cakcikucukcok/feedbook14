  <title>Messenger of Fear - Michael Grant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Michael Grant&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Messenger of Fear&lt;/em&gt; is a haunting narrative that examines the nature of good and evil in every human. Fans of Michelle Hodkin&amp;#39;s Mara Dyer trilogy and Stephen King will love this satisfyingly twisted series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mara Todd wakes in a field of dead grass, a heavy mist pressing down on her. She is terrified, afraid that she is dead. She can&amp;#39;t remember who she is or anything about her past. Is it because of the boy who appears? He calls himself the Messenger of Fear. If the world does not bring justice to those who do evil, the Messenger will. He offers the wicked a game. If they win, they go free. If they lose, they will live their greatest fear. Either way, their sanity will be challenged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a world of fair but harsh justice. Of retribution and redemption. And mystery. Why was Mara chosen to be the Messenger&amp;#39;s apprentice? What has she done to deserve this terrible fate? She won&amp;#39;t find out until three of the wicked receive justice. And when she does, she will be shattered.&lt;/p&gt;" />
