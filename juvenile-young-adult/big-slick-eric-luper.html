      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;All in all, sixteen-year-old Andrew Lang has been dealt a pretty good hand in life. Sure, he has to spend his afternoons slaving away in the hellhole that is his dad&#39;s dry-cleaning business, but even that&#39;s not so bad with Jasmine, the seriously hot Goth-chick senior, working right beside him.

Unfortunately, all it takes is one bad beat at Shushie&#39;s illegal poker club to turn Andrew&#39;s bankroll from huge to nonexistent. And Andrew&#39;s pretty sure that sooner or later his dad&#39;s going to notice that $600 he &quot;borrowed&quot; from the register.
