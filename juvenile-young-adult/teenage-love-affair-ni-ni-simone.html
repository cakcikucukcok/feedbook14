  <title>Teenage Love Affair - Ni-Ni Simone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Check it: I&#39;m Zsa-Zsa. Some call me arrogant, but I call it confidence. You decide when you find out what I&#39;m working with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First things first--I&#39;m seventeen, but I&#39;m grown and have been for a long time. I have my own ride, my mama doesn&#39;t clock my time, and my boyfriend, Ameen, is getting money like you wouldn&#39;t believe. There&#39;s only one problem: when Ameen gets mad, sometimes he takes his anger out on me. And yeah, maybe I could leave him, but there&#39;s no way Ameen could imagine being without me. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So now I&#39;m all confused, especially since my first love, Malachi, is back in my life. Ameen is not giving up without a fight, and no matter how hard I try, the love I have for Malachi won&#39;t go away. And did I mention that Malachi has a girl? Needless to say, my days are filled with drama. So this is my story and you need to come and chill with me as I try and see what boy is for me, what love is all about, and if my first teenage love affair will forever rule or ruin my life.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for Ni-Ni Simone&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &quot;Urban teen readers may recognize their friends and themselves in the language, music and feel of this fluffy-but-fun read.&quot;  --&lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews &lt;/i&gt;on &lt;i&gt;If I Was Your Girl&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Ni-Ni Simone&#39;s fast-paced writing keeps me coming back for more.&quot;  --L.
