  <title>GRASSHOPPER - An American Indian Folktale - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 385&lt;br /&gt;
In this 385th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the Fairy Tale &amp;quot;GRASSHOPPER&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
A long time ago amongst the Algonquin people of North America there lived a merry young Native American who could jump so high, and who played so many pranks, that he came to be known to all as Grasshopper. He was a tall, handsome fellow, always up to mischief of one kind or another; and though his tricks were sometimes amusing, he carried them much too far, and so in time he came to grief.&lt;br /&gt;
If people put up with his ways, and even laughed at some of his mad pranks, it was because he could dance so well. Never before, and since, had there been such a dancer. He could dance with a step so light that it seemed to leave no mark upon the earth. He could dance as the Indian dances when he goes to war, or as when he holds a festival in honor of the corn. But the dance in which he excelled was a furious, dizzy dance, with leaps and bounds, that fairly turned the heads of the beholders.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once, when the great Manito, named Man-a-bo-zho, took a wife and came to live with the tribe, that he might teach them best how to live, Grasshopper danced at the wedding. The Beggar&amp;#39;s Dance, he called it, and such a dance! On the shores of the Big-Sea-Water, Gitche Gumee, are heaps of sand rising into little hills known as dunes. Had you asked Iagoo, he would have told you that these dunes were the work of Grasshopper, who whirled the sands together, and piled them into hills, as he spun madly around in his dance at Man-a-bo-zho&amp;#39;s wedding.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bored with village life, one day Grasshopper plays a trick on Man-a-bo-zho which was a grave insult. Man-a-bo-zho swears revenge and the chase is on&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;..&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What happened next you ask&amp;hellip;? Well many things happened, some silly and some serious. To find the answers to these questions, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out for yourselves!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
