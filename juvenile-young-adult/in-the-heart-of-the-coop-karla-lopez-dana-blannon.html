  <title>In the Heart of the Coop - Karla Lopez, Dana Blannon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a crisis in the chicken coop! Until now, everyone has followed the rules laid out by Wise Mother Hen like being kind and respectful, doing chores, and caring for eggs. Now, Millie and her troublesome pals have decided they don&#39;t like the rules so much and go against the grain in the name of their own selfish and dangerous desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best friends Dark Cloud and Sunshine are worried. Dark Cloud assumes Millie is up to no good, but patient Sunshine wants to give Millie a chance. It&#39;s not long before Millie meets Mr. Rat and makes a deal. In exchange for yummy pumpkin seeds, she&#39;ll let Mr. Rat ran into the coop to eat some of the fresh eggs, much to Dark Cloud&#39;s horror!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunshine still wants to give Millie the benefit of the doubt but when Mr. Rat seriously injures a hen, even Sunshine sees the trouble her fellow chicken has caused. Will the injured hen survive? What will be Millie&#39;s punishment? See the cost of her mistakes, whether she&#39;ll be forgiven, and if this cozy coop will ever be the same again.&lt;/p&gt;" />
