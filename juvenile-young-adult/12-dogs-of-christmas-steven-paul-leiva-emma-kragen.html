      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Now available as a novel based on the screenplay written by Kieth Merrill, this story is destined to become a classic for young readers during the holiday season.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;The film centers around 12-year-old Emma O&#39;Connor as she is sent to live with her &quot;aunt&quot; in the small town of Doverville. Emma soon finds herself in the middle of a &quot;dog-fight&quot; with the mayor and town dogcatcher. In order to strike down their &quot;no-dogs&quot; law, Emma must bring together a group of schoolmates, grown-ups, and adorable dogs of all shapes and sizes in a spectacular holiday pageant. The &lt;EM&gt;12 Dogs of Christmas&lt;/EM&gt; is a fun, heartwarming story, featuring a diverse canine cast and is perfect for all those who love dogs, kids, and Christmas. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;The &lt;EM&gt;12 Dogs of Christmas&lt;/EM&gt; was first introduced as a picture book and board book with companion CD written by then 8-year-old, Emma Kragen. Now with over 500,000 books sold, the story has been expanded into a feature-length film. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&quot;Leiva recounts the story in a very crisp, snappy style of prose which is full of humor and warmth...it&#39;s on it&#39;s way to becoming a Christmas standard.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Stuart Nulman &quot;Bookbanter&quot; on CJAD, Montreal&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;" />
