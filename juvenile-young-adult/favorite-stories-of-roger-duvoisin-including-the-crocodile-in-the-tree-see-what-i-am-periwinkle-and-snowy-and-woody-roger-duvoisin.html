  <title>Favorite Stories of Roger Duvoisin: Including The Crocodile in the Tree, See What I Am, Periwinkle, and Snowy and Woody - Roger Duvoisin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This single-volume edition gathers four of the most famous animal stories by Caldecott-winning author and illustrator Roger Duvoisin, the creator of Petunia, the famous silly goose. Richly illustrated with charming watercolor images, the tales of friendship and discovery include:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Crocodile in the Tree.&lt;/I&gt;&amp;nbsp;A crocodile is&amp;nbsp;kind and friendly, but because of his scary-looking teeth, no one wants to be friends with him &amp;#8213; until Bertha the duck takes him under her wing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;See What I Am. &lt;/I&gt;Max the kitten observes as primary colors develop into secondary colors in the many-hued world of nature.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Periwinkle. &lt;/I&gt;A lonesome giraffe, unable to communicate with other creatures, is delighted to meet a frog that speaks the same language. Both animals discover that being able to talk really isn&#39;t more important than listening. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Snowy and Woody.&lt;/I&gt; A polar bear who&#39;s as white as the snow sets out from his Arctic home to investigate southern lands where bears are brown and grass is green.&lt;BR&gt;" />
