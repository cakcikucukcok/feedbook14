  <title>Why Does Everything Happen to Me? - Alice B. Jempsa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life isnt easy for a little boy who isnt responsible. Sometimes hes late for school. He makes a mess when he eats because he doesnt pay attention. His big brother calls him a dumb little kid, and its so frustrating when he forgets to do his homework! Even worse, being irresponsible can get him into big trouble.
Why Does Everything Happen to Me? tells the story of one young boy, learning the importance of responsibility. Its hard being a kid, remembering so many things: homework, lunch money, and soccer practice. Why should a kid so small be expected to remember so much anyway?
There is a valuable lesson to be learned, however, even when we mess up. The little boy must come to terms with it, especially when his mom asks, Who forgot his homework? Who forgot his lunch money? Who is to blame? Even little kids cant always depend on adults to get things done; sometimes little kids have to be responsible. Its all part of growing up!" />
