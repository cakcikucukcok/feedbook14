  <title>Steinbeck&#39;s Ghost - Lewis Buzbee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been two months since Travis&#39;s family moved to a development so new that it seems totally unreal. His parents are working harder now, to pay for it all, and Travis is left to fend for himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s one place, though, where Travis can still connect with his old life: the Salinas library. Travis and his family used to go there together every Saturday, but now he bikes to it alone, re-reading his favorite books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s only natural that Travis likes the work of author John Steinbeck--after all, Salinas is Steinbeck&#39;s hometown. But that can&#39;t explain why Travis is suddenly seeing Steinbeck&#39;s characters spring to life. There&#39;s the homeless man in the alley behind the library, the line of figures at the top of a nearby ridge, the boy who writes by night in an attic bedroom. Travis has met them all before--as a reader. But why are they here now? And how?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Travis struggles to solve this mystery, budget cuts threaten his library. And so, he embarks on a journey through Steinbeck&#39;s beautiful California landscape, looking for a way to save his safe haven. It&#39;s only then that he begins to sort out fact from fiction, discovering the many ways a story can come alive--and stumbling into a story Steinbeck might have started, and Travis needs to complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a mystery that delves deeply into the ways that books take us, one at a time, out into the vast world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
