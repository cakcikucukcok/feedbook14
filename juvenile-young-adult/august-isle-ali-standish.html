      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*A Junior Library Guild Selection*&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From c&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ritically acclaimed author Ali Standish (&lt;em&gt;The Ethan I Was Before&lt;/em&gt;), the story of o&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ne girl&amp;#8217;s journey to a magical seaside town, where she uncovers her family&amp;#8217;s long hidden secrets and ultimately finds truth and redemption. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fans of Sharon Creech and Rebecca Stead will be captivated by this story filled with warm humor, mystery, whimsy, and characters you can&amp;#8217;t let go. A modern classic in the making!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, Miranda has stared at postcards of August Isle, Florida. The town where her mother spent her summers as a girl. The town that Miranda has always ached to visit. She just never wanted it to happen this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she arrives on the Isle, alone and uncertain, to stay the summer with an old friend of her mother&amp;#8217;s, Miranda discovers a place even more perfect than she imagined. And she finds a new friend in Sammy, &amp;#8220;Aunt&amp;#8221; Clare&amp;#8217;s daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is more to August Isle than its bright streets and sandy beaches, and soon Miranda is tangled in a web of mysteries. A haunted lighthouse. An old seafarer with something to hide. A name reaching out from her mother&amp;#8217;s shadowy past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As she closes in on answers, Miranda must reckon with the biggest question of all: Is she brave enough to face the truth she might uncover?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;A beautifully written story. An emotional journey of family, friendship, loss, and healing.&amp;#8221; &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kirkus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
