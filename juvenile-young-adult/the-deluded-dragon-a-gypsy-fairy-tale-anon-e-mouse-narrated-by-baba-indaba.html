  <title>THE DELUDED DRAGON - A Gypsy Fairy Tale - Anon E. Mouse, Narrated by Baba Indaba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 423&lt;br /&gt;
In this 423rd issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the Gypsy fairy tales of &amp;quot;The Deluded Dragon&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A long time ago in Eastern Europe a man lived in a cave in the forest with his many children. He said to his children, &amp;#39;Make me a honey-cake, for I will go and earn something.&amp;#39; He went into the forest, and found a well. By the well was a table. He laid the cake on the table and presently fell asleep. The crows came and ate it. When he arose he saw the flies eating the crumbs. He struck a blow and killed a hundred flies. He wrote that he had killed a hundred souls with one blow. And he lay down again and slept.&lt;br /&gt;
A dragon came with a buffalo&amp;#39;s skin to draw water. He saw what was written on the table, that he had killed a hundred souls. When he saw the old man, he feared. The old man awoke, and he too feared.&lt;br /&gt;
In fear, the dragon said, &amp;#39;Let&amp;#39;s become brothers.&amp;#39;&lt;br /&gt;
And so began a strange relationship with one always trying to gain the upper-hand over the other.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What happened next you ask&amp;hellip;? Well, as you would expect in these circumstances,&amp;nbsp; many things happened. To find the answers to this question, and any others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
