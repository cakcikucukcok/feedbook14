  <title>The Vegetable Patch - Lynne Masson, Laura Sawyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Clara is a glamorous carrot who is a bit bossy too.  She loves nothing better than to have centre stage in the vegetable patch.  Brodie broccoli is a good friend of Claras, but Ollie onion is a bit jealous of her.  It is a journey that starts in the vegetable patch and ends in a village fete competition, with fun and laughter all the way through.  My grandchildren followed the story all the way through the writing of it and could not wait till I had written the next page.  It was their bedtime story for weeks and of course they gave me their comments on how the story was unfolding, which was helpful in writing it.  The illustrations are by my daughter-in-law which also tells the story really well.  I hope you enjoy the book." />
