  <title>The Magic Horse - Claudia Casciato</title>
      <meta name="description" content="During a stormy night Clare heard a thud. She peaked out. A bubble of green light floated in the air. When it burst, a white horse appeared with gold wings and a black diamond on its forehead.&lt;br /&gt;
Raphael, the magic horse took her to visit Heaven before she found out about Mary Ellen, her best friends accident. He told Clare that she would be a secret agent of God. She would teach others about the healing powers of Heaven. Her assignment was to help Mary Ellens mom cope with her death.&lt;br /&gt;
At the funeral, Clare saw her use white feathers to tickle her and the other children. Clare and Mary Ellen shared a magical spiritual journey on Earth. Willie, Clares dog was part of the assignment. They visited a healing pond where they shared an adventure.&lt;br /&gt;
She struggled with Mary Ellens death. Her mother and Mary Ellens mom did notbelieve about her presence in spirit.&lt;br /&gt;
She and Mary Ellen shared humorous moments during their journey. One moment was at the psychologists office. Dr. Goodall believed Clare about Mary Ellens presence when he witnessed magic.&lt;br /&gt;
In the end Clares mother believed her daughter saw Mary Ellens presence in spirit. Mary Ellen made a connection with her mother. Clare released her anger and experienced a magical wonderland in the cemetery with Raphael. &lt;br /&gt;
Believe in yourself and you will conquer all." />
