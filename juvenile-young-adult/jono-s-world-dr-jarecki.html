  <title>Jono’S World - Dr. Jarecki</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ever wonder what it would be like to be a kid again? Wonder no more. When I heard my first story in the book entitled Jonos World - The Farting Gorilla - the title was enough to attract me to want to sit and listen to a story about a Farting Gorilla. It gave me that long ago feeling that I was a kid again in Storybook Land, leaving adulthood behind. And at the end of these stories each one embodying an AHA moment, an invaluable teaching tool, and a moral at the end of every story. Something in each of these stories even adults can benefit from. It made me realize that we all have a bit of child in us, and with a little practice, we can create wonderful tools for our children, bond with them and teach them all at the same time. This is a spectacular creation by Dr. Steven Jarecki. It is more than a one of a kind adventure; IT IS AN EXPERIENCE!
