  <title>Time to Sleep: The Rainie and Bensen Series - Susan Marie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rainie and Bensen are two lovable dogs who are very tired. They know it is time for bed, but they really like being awake too!  As darkness falls and the stars come out to twinkle for the night, Rainie and Bensen take a bath. It&#39;s so good to be clean. After they put their toys away, the little pups ask for a drink of water before they slip deep under the covers. With one last kiss and a wish for sweet dreams, Rainie and Bensen snuggle in tight and close their eyes.  Time to Sleep is the colorful tale of two golden doodles as they prepare for bed and show children how to softly fall asleep." />
