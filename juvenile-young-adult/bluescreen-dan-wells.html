      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Bluescreen&lt;/em&gt; is a stunning deluge of imagination, filled with suspense and twists and unforgettable characters. This book is just plain awesome.&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;James Dashner, bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Maze Runner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Dan Wells, author of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling Partials Sequence, comes the first book in a new sci-fi-noir series. Los Angeles in 2050 is a city of open doors, as long as you have the right connections. That connection is a djinni&amp;#8212;a smart device implanted right in a person&amp;#8217;s head. In a world where virtually everyone is online twenty-four hours a day, this connection is like oxygen&amp;#8212;and a world like that presents plenty of opportunities for someone who knows how to manipulate it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marisa Carneseca is one of those people. She might spend her days in Mirador, but she lives on the net&amp;#8212;going to school, playing games, hanging out, or doing things of more questionable legality with her friends Sahara and Anja. And it&amp;#8217;s Anja who first gets her hands on Bluescreen&amp;#8212;a virtual drug that plugs right into a person&amp;#8217;s djinni and delivers a massive, nonchemical, completely safe high. But in this city, when something sounds too good to be true, it usually is, and Mari and her friends soon find themselves in the middle of a conspiracy that is much bigger than they ever suspected.&lt;/p&gt;" />
