Perfect for fans of the Nevermoor and His Dark Materials series.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ember St. George is a dragon. At least she was before her adoptive father&amp;#8212;a powerful but accident-prone Magician&amp;#8212;turned her into a human girl to save her life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Ember&amp;#8217;s growing tendency to burst into flames at certain temperatures&amp;#8212;not to mention her invisible wings&amp;#8212;is making it too dangerous for her to stay in London. The solution: ship Ember off to her aunt&amp;#8217;s research station in frigid Antarctica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though eccentric Aunt Myra takes getting used to, Ember quickly feels at home in a land of ice storms, mischievous penguins, and twenty-four-hour nights. She even finds herself making friends with a girl genius called Nisha and a mysterious orphan named Moss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then she discovers that Antarctica is home to the Winterglass Hunt, a yearly tradition in which rare ice dragons are hunted for their jeweled scales. Furious, Ember decides to join the hunt to sabotage it from the inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But being an undercover dragon isn&amp;#8217;t easy&amp;#8212;especially among dragon hunters. Can a twelve-year-old fire dragon survive the dangers that come her way in the Antarctic wilderness and protect the ice dragons from extinction?&lt;/p&gt;" />
