  <title>Untamed City: Carnival of Secrets - Melissa Marr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Warriors Kaleb and Aya will stop at nothing to destroy their competition. But when Kaleb finds his fate entwined with that of Mallory, a seventeen-year-old human girl, he can&amp;#39;t seem to separate the vicious Carnival contest he&amp;#39;s entered from his sudden devotion to her. He and Aya may be prizefighters from the otherworldly Untamed City, but his strange, obsessive connection makes staying away from the witch-ruled human world, and Mallory, harder every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All Mallory knows of the Untamed City is what her elders have told her&amp;#8212;that it&amp;#39;s full of debauchery and daimons looking to destroy her. But she knows she&amp;#39;s being pulled toward Kaleb with an emotion so fierce that it&amp;#39;s utterly foreign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two are forced apart by Mallory&amp;#39;s overprotective witch father, stranded by necessity between warring populations that can&amp;#39;t coexist. But when The City&amp;#39;s ruler raises the stakes of the Carnival&amp;#39;s prize, there&amp;#39;s nothing Mallory, Kaleb, or Aya can do to stop the two worlds colliding. Mallory&amp;#39;s about to discover her true identity&amp;#8212;and stumble into a fate she&amp;#39;d die to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fans of &lt;em&gt;The Hunger Games&lt;/em&gt; will devour this tale of lush secrets, dark love, and the struggle to forge one&amp;#39;s own destiny from the bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Wicked Lovely&lt;/em&gt;, Melissa Marr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Formerly published as &lt;em&gt;Carnival of Souls&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;" />
