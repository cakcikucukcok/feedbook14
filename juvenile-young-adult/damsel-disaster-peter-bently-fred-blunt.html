  <title>Damsel Disaster! - Peter Bently, Fred Blunt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Cedric Thatchbottom can&#39;t wait to train as a squire, serving Sir Percival the Proud a knight famed throughout the land for his glorious deeds. But this famous knight isn&#39;t all he appears to be, and Cedric soon finds himself being run ragged around Castle Bombast by his new master. In Book 3 of the Knightmare series, a wealthy princess is visiting the kingdom in search of a husband, and Sir Percy has a plot up his sleeve to see off the other potential suitors. As usual, Cedric has a key part to play in his master&#39;s plan. Ugh! Dressing up as a maiden in silk bloomers wasn&#39;t quite what he had in mind when he signed up to be a squire. A hilarious new series following the misadventures of a trainee knight. Packed with comical characters, battles, puns and poo, these books are irresistible to young readers aged six to eight years." />
