  <title>Para Troupers: The Case of Old Man Rutledge - Mark Stephen Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Imagine you and some of your closest friends decide to find a new place to hang out. You don&#39;t want the same old type of hangout. No, you want something special. And just when you think you have found the perfect one, well, it turns out to be more than it seems.   In his book, Para Troupers: The Case of Old Man Rutledge, author Mark Stephen Johnson tells such a story. A group of teen friends in the town of Spider Lake stumble across a vacant, haunted mansion. They have hopes of making it the next great hangout in town. But little did they know the mansion hides a violent past and a curious link to one of the clairvoyant teens who found it. More than one entity haunts this palatial estate ... and not all of them are friendly.   Para Troupers: The Case of Old Man Rutledge is an exciting, paranormal thriller about a rescue mission and a deadly game when supernatural entities resist and threaten the teens&#39; lives. Hold on tight as the friends come together to confront the evil in front of them." />
