  <title>Book of Lyrics - Dr. Martha Bushore-Fallis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Praise for Freedom Found&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we search for answers to prevention of violence in our communities, I believe our children will lead the way to a more peaceful world by learning to make wise choices. I strongly recommend Freedom Found, an original story dramatizing the importance of making wise choices.&lt;br /&gt;Paula Oliver Pell, MD, FACEP, FAAP, past president, Southern Medical Association&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lessons well taught at home will endure. And young people learn best through intergenerational interactivity. So this volume is an absolute gold mine for parents who wish to homeschool their children and youth in values education. The best part is that the learning process that you choose will be fun. Freedom Found has much inspiration and many creative possibilities for your family, and even for your neighbourhood. Dont pass this one by!&lt;br /&gt;Rev. John Harries, MDiv, spiritual educator and family counselor, Toronto, Ontario&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message of the story of Freedom Found is timely, necessary, and true.&lt;br /&gt;Jane Russell Geddings, choreographer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Freedom Found is a story of tragedy, triumph, and the power of the human spirit. Through the use of theater, music, and movement, this drama tells a moving tale of one familys struggle for dignity and hope across three generations. Designed to inspire empathy in children, teens, and families, it describes a move from victimization to empowerment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their homeland, the family paid a heavy price in their fight for freedom of choice. To protect the surviving members from the extremist regime that took the father, they escape to what they hope are safer lands. But in their new home, they encounter oppression of a different kind. Although they are earnest, industrious, and principled, frequent challenges arise to test their resolve. Thanks to wise decision-making, their tenacity and identity as individuals and as a family only increase. Despite tough times in their new home, the family is determined to emerge stronger, with renewed perspective, insight, and self-respect. The cost has certainly been high, but they never lose hope for a bright future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theirs is a compelling story of struggle, pride, pain, and victory. Offering valuable life lessons, Freedom Found is a new musical journey for the stage, the story of the quest for the freedom to Choose Who to Be.TM&lt;/p&gt;" />
