  <title>When a Lion Roars - Ishora Koji</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Thirty years and still no justice. Not for the lions. Not for the elephants. Not for the monkeys. Not for anyone living in the Jungle of Five Rivers.  The lions bicker amongst themselves over scraps the dragons allow them. A lion sits as a puppet ruler telling lions to forget the extermination of their ancestors while the dragons use him to put down yet another rebellion to their rule. The lions have been fully assimilated into the caste fold. The free and tolerant champions of the oppressed are no more.  And yet...there is hope...for one lion alone can help the jungle remember truth. And truth finds a way. Truth always finds a way.   &quot;Stunningly powerful! A must read for those interested in the 1984 Sikh genocide!&quot; Daya Singh, author of &#39;Days of Black&#39;    &quot;Gripping, nonstop action and one hell of a story! You&#39;ll view what happened to the Sikhs in 1984 in a whole new way! Amazing!&quot; Eli Mann, author of &#39;Night of the Widows&#39;" />
