  <title>When It&#39;s Real - Erin Watt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Wealth, fame and a real-life romance she never expected–seventeen-year-old Vaughn Bennett lands it all when she agrees to become a pop star&#39;s fake girlfriend in this smart, utterly addictive novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author duo Erin Watt&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Under ordinary circumstances, Oakley Ford and Vaughn Bennett would never even cross paths.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There&#39;s nothing ordinary about Oakley. This bad-boy pop star&#39;s got Grammy Awards, millions of fangirls and a reputation as a restless, too-charming troublemaker. But with his home life disintegrating, his music well suddenly running dry and the tabloids having a field day over his outrageous exploits, Oakley needs to show the world he&#39;s settling down–and who better to help him than Vaughn, a part-time waitress trying to help her family get by? The very definition of ordinary.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Posing as his girlfriend, Vaughn will overhaul Oakley&#39;s image from troublemaker to serious artist. In return for enough money to put her brothers through college, she can endure outlandish Hollywood parties and carefully orchestrated Twitter exchanges. She&#39;ll fool the paparazzi and the groupies. She might even start fooling herself a little.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Because when ordinary rules no longer apply, there&#39;s no telling what your heart will do…&lt;/p&gt;
