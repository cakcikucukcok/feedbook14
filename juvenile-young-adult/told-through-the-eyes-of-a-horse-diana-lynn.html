His owner, Diana, had a love for the heart of the cross, and her mission goal was to raise Sterling as her Jesus horse. Together they were to share the gospel message of Gods love on horseback. Bonding in a horse/owner relationship brought them into living in the heart of each others life dream. &lt;br&gt;
