  <title>Shadow of a Girl - Shannon Greenland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Gritty and intense, the tension sizzles off the pages!&quot; -&lt;b&gt;Kimberly Derting, author of The Taking&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use cash and keep moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After I ran away from home, these were the two rules that dictated my life. Scoring a job as a roadie fit perfectly for what I needed. Traveling, cash, and life out of the spotlight.  But when my path collides with West, the lead singer of Bus Stop, I can&#39;t seem to stay out of his spotlight--especially since we&#39;ll be touring together for an entire year.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;West is determined to break down my walls. He won&#39;t give up. And little by little they come crumbling. But if he knew what lurked behind them, he wouldn&#39;t be so eager to get rid of them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more time we spend together, the more the lines of our friendship become blurred. He makes me dream of things I never thought possible. But while our friendship has been evolving into a romance, my secrets have been closing in. And just when I&#39;ve decided to reveal my past to West, I&#39;m confronted by it. The cost of my freedom could ruin the life of the guy I love...&lt;/p&gt;" />
