      <meta name="description" content="A great read for children - in summer and for reading around a crackling fire on a cold winter night!&lt;br /&gt;

Even if you haven&amp;rsquo;t read some of these stories, you can rest assured that all will entertain with their content and Thornton Oakley&amp;rsquo;s abundant illustrations are bound to fire young imaginations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this volume you will find Stories like:&lt;br /&gt;
The Castle of Comorre&lt;br /&gt;
The Basin of Gold and the Diamond Lance&lt;br /&gt;
Lady Yolanda&amp;#39;s Thimble&lt;br /&gt;
The Witch of Lok Island&lt;br /&gt;
Little White-Thorn and the Talking Bird&lt;br /&gt;
Princess Ahez and the Lost City&lt;br /&gt;
The Changeling&lt;br /&gt;
The Foster Brother&lt;br /&gt;
The Hunchback and the Elves&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
