  <title>The African Girl - Justina U. Anumbor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Our generation is bedeviled with moral bankruptcy that is nearly bringing mankind to a fast, catastrophic end. The family unit is the most affected, where its seeds are devastated by the social turbulence of the day. To some have been given the eyes of the eagle and the wisdom of the tortoise to build a strong defense around their seeds. Justina U. Anumbor issues warnings of these evil manifestations, through tales and folklores of old, cutting across the tradition of the people to catch the young generation of our time and teaching them to eschew evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In THE AFRICAN GIRL, Justina U. Anumbor tells the story of a young girl whose parents were separated at an early age: &lt;/br&gt;
How she was raised by her father and the painful experience of poverty.&lt;/br&gt;
The tales by moonlight that she listened to served as strong weapons that wielded, channeled, and launched her into success.&lt;/br&gt;
She had to fulfill the tradition of circumcision as a requirement for marriage.&lt;/br&gt;
Once married, she went through personal conflicts as to the essence of marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE AFRICAN GIRL inspires the youth to overcome challenges that would otherwise have impeded their destinies. What Justina, is saying here is that there is no problem facing man under the sun that has no solution, if that individual is willing to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
