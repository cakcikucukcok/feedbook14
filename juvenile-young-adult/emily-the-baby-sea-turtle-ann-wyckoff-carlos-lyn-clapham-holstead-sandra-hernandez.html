  <title>Emily, the Baby Sea Turtle - Ann Wyckoff Carlos, Lyn Clapham Holstead, Sandra Hernandez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The story of Emily, the Baby Sea Turtle begins with her birth on a beach in Mexico.  After she leaves her egg, she meets a small girl who carries her to the sea.  But huge waves toss Emily back onto the sandy beach, where she is threatened by animal predators. As Emily struggles to reach the sea, the hot sun almost overcomes her. Miraculously, her small friend appears once again to help her return to the ocean. 
This book, written in English and Spanish, is fascinating for readers of any age who love animals and want to learn more about sea turtles. The author, who works with a Mexican sea turtle conservation program, follows the birth and return to the sea of an endangered Olive Ridley hatchling and describes the protection practices that save her. 
The first book in this series is Anny, The Sea Turtle. In this story Anny, Emilys mother, makes the difficult journey to her nesting place in Mexico." />
