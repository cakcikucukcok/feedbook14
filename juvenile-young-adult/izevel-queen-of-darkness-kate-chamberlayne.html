  <title>Izevel, Queen of Darkness - Kate Chamberlayne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Slowly, slowly, slowly, Izevel Princess of Tyre, works her influence over her new husband, Ahav, and his kingdom Israel. Leading them away from Adonai, she encourages the unspeakable practices of Baal worship. But despite her best efforts, the Lord and his prophets will not be disposed of so easily. Increasingly driven mad by her own lifestyle, Izevel races headlong towards her own grisly downfall.
Through the relationship between Izevel and Elijah, and later Elisha, the reader explores the question of following the Lord and how idols of all kinds can pull people away from God. We see the pain of Elijah at God&#39;s people&#39;s stubborness and sin in rejecting the ways they were taught by their ancestors. Who is there left to tell the next generation the praiseworthy deeds of the Lord? The author uses the Bible text and historical evidence of Baal worship to create this fascinating and challenging account of how worldly influences can take hold and drag people from following the word of the Lord. However, there is a message of hope, as Izevel ultimately does not succeed.
The Dark Chapters series tell some of the darker stories from the Bible. The books in this series focus on the story of one character from the Bible and see how their life compares to how God wants us to live. They also examine what happens as a consequence of them not following God&#39;s plan for their lives. The text does not sensationalise the horrific aspects of each story for entertainment&#39;s sake, and therefore trivialise what it has to say. On the contrary, each retold account uses the more fantastic and gruesome episodes of each character&#39;s story to grip the reader and draw them into assessing why these events take place. The reader is asked throughout the books to consider questions about the nature of God, how we should live as Christians, what value we place on things of this world - power, wealth, influence or popularity - and what God values." />
