  <title>Hard Egg and Cracked Egg, What Two Really Naughty Egg’S! - Dee Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This story is all about two Egg&#39;s who are Brothers,Hard Egg&#39; and &#39;Cracked Egg&#39;, who are always causing trouble around the village of Eggville. They get up to all sorts of antics and never think of the consequences of their actions. Well there Mother, who is called Eggie May told them that she would take them on a special trip to the Eggville Zoo, if theycould stay out of any trouble for longer than a week. Buttheir Father, who is called Sargent Eggward Egg, told their Mother, that they probably wouldn&#39;t evenlast a day! Well how right he was. Hard Egg and Cracked Egg, well it all went wrong for them as soon as they frightened their Mother with that loud bang from the cracker they pulled behind her.The day just got worse for them, they made Softie Egg fall off the wall, caught poor Runny Egg and tied him to a tree, took Nurse Clucky&#39;s favourite garden gnome, tripped up little Chocolate Egg, were rude to Old Poached Egg, threw mud at their Auntie Eggstra&#39;s dress, kicked Old Egg Plant in the leg, pulled Chicky Egg&#39;s hair, even told lots of lie&#39;s. But they had not counted on being seen by P.C.Egg and being caught by P.C. Eggwin Egg. So alas they were both taken home to their Mother, who sent them to bed. And if you look through the book, I don&#39;t even think at time&#39;s they were really sorry at all, and do we believe those tear&#39;s of theirs with smiley faces, I don&#39;t think so. What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;" />
