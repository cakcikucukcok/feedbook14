  <title>THE YELLOW FAIRY BOOK - Illustrated Edition - Anon E. Mouse,  Illustrated by H. J. Ford, Compiled and Edited by Andrew Lang</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Europe had the Grimm Brothers and the UK and English speaking nations had Andrew Lang. Here is Lang&amp;#39;s YELLOW FAIRY BOOK, yet another of his Many Cloloured Fairy Books. This extraordinary volume contains 37 old and forgotten folk and fairy tales including stories like stories Lovely Ilonka, Lucky Luck, The Hairy Man, To Your Good Health! and The Story of the Seven Simons. It also contains Russian, German, French, Icelandic, American (Red) Indian, and other tales from around the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There was a time when the president of the Folk Lore Society believed it was not acceptable for the editors of the day, in particular Mr Andrew Lang and Mr. Joseph Jacobs, to publish fairy books. Their reply was that they did not see any harm in it, and they were ready to &amp;#39;put themselves on their country,&amp;#39; and be tried by a jury of children.&amp;nbsp; And so they were proving the President of the FLS wrong.&lt;br /&gt;
This book also contains many references to fairies. As to whether there are really any fairies or not, is a difficult question.&amp;nbsp; Andrew Lang never saw any himself, but he knew several people who have seen them-in the Highlands-and heard their music.&amp;nbsp; If ever you are near Nether Lochaber, go to the Fairy Hill, and you may hear the music your-self, as grown-up people have done, but you must go on a fine day.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
If fairies really do not exist, why do so many people believe in them, the world over?&amp;nbsp; The ancient Greeks, the old Egyptians, the Hindus, the Chinese, the Africans and even the Native Americans claim to have seen them and it is unlikely that so many different peoples would have seen and heard them?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Editor cannot say &amp;#39;good-bye&amp;#39; without advising children, as they pursue their studies, to read &lt;i&gt;The Rose and the Ring&lt;/i&gt;, by the late Mr. Thackeray.&amp;nbsp; He believes this book is quite indispensable in every child&amp;#39;s library, and parents should be urged to purchase it at the first opportunity, as without it no education is really complete.&lt;br /&gt;
