  <title>Mom Had a Stroke - Delanie L. Stephenson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Katie, a six-year-old girl, loved her life. She had everything she needed: a house in the country with pets, a devoted family, and a fun-loving mom who would do anything for her. Katie had no worries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, unexpectedly near the end of her kindergarten school year, her mother suffered a life-altering stroke. Katies mom transitioned from a happy-go-lucky mom to one who lost her ability to walk and talk. For the first time in her life, Katie was really scared and worried what was going to happen to her mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Katie lost her old mom, she gained a new mom who turned out to be very different. Life was altered from what it once was, but it wasnt so bad because through it all, Katie was lucky to have her mom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A book for children, Mom Had a Stroke explores how one little girl felt as she learned to accept and adjust to a new mom with physical challenges, and how, over time, they began to experience happiness as a family again.&lt;/p&gt;" />
