  <title>Heart of a Samurai - Margi Preus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1841 a Japanese fishing vessel sinks. Its crew is forced to swim to a small, unknown island, where they are rescued by a passing American ship. Japan&amp;rsquo;s borders remain closed to all Western nations, so the crew sets off to America, learning English on the way.&lt;BR&gt;Manjiro, a 14-year-old boy, is curious and eager to learn everything he can about this new culture. Eventually the captain adopts Manjiro and takes him to his home in New England. The boy lives there for some time and then heads to San Francisco to pan for gold. After many years, he makes it back to Japan, only to be imprisoned as an outsider. With his hard-won knowledge of the West, Manjiro is in a unique position to persuade the emperor to ease open the boundaries around Japan; he may even achieve his unlikely dream of becoming a samurai.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Heart of a Samurai&lt;/i&gt; is a 2011 Newbery Honor Book.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Accolades and Praise for &lt;I&gt;Heart of a Samurai&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;2011 Newbery Honor Book&lt;I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;Bestseller&lt;I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;NPR Backseat Book Club pick&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;quot;A terrifc biographical novel by Margi Preus.&amp;quot; -&lt;I&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;*STARRED REVIEW*&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;rsquo;s  a classic fish-out-of-water story (although this fish goes into the  water repeatedly), and it&amp;rsquo;s precisely this classic structure that gives  the novel the sturdy bones of a timeless tale. Backeted by gritty  seafaring episodes&amp;mdash;salty and bloody enough to assure us that Preus has  done her research&amp;mdash;the book&amp;rsquo;s heart is its middle section, in which  Manjiro, allegedly the first Japanese to set foot in America, deals with  the prejudice and promise of a new world.
