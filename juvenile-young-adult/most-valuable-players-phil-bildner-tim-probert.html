  <title>Most Valuable Players - Phil Bildner, Tim Probert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In the fourth book of the Rip and Red series, the two boys have one last basketball thrill ride before the end of fifth grade.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s fifth-grade graduation time for Rip and Red, and this year&#39;s festivities are going to be extra special because Reese Jones Elementary is also celebrating its twenty-fifth anniversary. As part of the gala, Hoops Machine, the exhibition basketball team, is paying a visit, and Rip may be playing a surprise role. But he and his friends need to finish their schoolwork first, which includes taking a newly required standardized test. However, when the students of Room 208 begin to question the need to take the test, a mini opt-out movement gains momentum. When the administration gets wind of this rebellion in Mr. Acevedo&#39;s class, Hoops Machine, middle-school basketball tryouts, and walking at the graduation ceremony are in jeopardy. So is Mr. A&#39;s job. But luckily for Rip, Red, their classmates, and their teacher, when you stand up for what you believe in, the people you&#39;ve touched along the way rally to your corner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Most Valuable Players &lt;/i&gt;is the fourth book in the Rip &amp; Red series, written by Phil Bildner with illustrations by Tim Probert.&lt;/p&gt;" />
