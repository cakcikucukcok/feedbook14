&lt;p&gt;
Look inside the book: &lt;p&gt;The girlish folly did not last long, and the letters were burned years ago; but Goethe is still my favorite author, and Emerson remained my beloved &#39;Master&#39; while he lived, doing more for me, as for many another young soul, than he ever knew, by the simple beauty of his life, the truth and wisdom of his books, the example of a good great man untempted and unspoiled by the world which he made nobler while in it, and left the richer when he went.
...They looked sad and ashamed, and Kitty sighed as she spoke, for all knew that father&#39;s headaches always began by his coming home stupid or cross, with only a part of his wages; and mother always cried when she thought they did not see her, and after the long sleep father looked as if he did n&#39;t like to meet their eyes, but went off early.
...As father said this with a choke in his voice, and mother&#39;s head went down on his shoulder to hide the happy tears that wet her cheeks, the children did n&#39;t know whether to laugh or cry, till Kitty, with the instinct of a loving heart, settled the question by saying, as she held out her hands, &#39;We have n&#39;t any tree, so let&#39;s dance around our goodies and be merry.&#39;
&lt;p&gt;About Louisa May Alcott, the Author:&lt;P&gt; 1 Raised by her transcendentalist parents, Abigail May and Amos Bronson Alcott in New England, she grew up among many of the well-known intellectuals of the day such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau. 
...In 1847, she and her family served as station masters on the Underground Railroad, when they housed a fugitive slave for one week and in 1848 Alcott read and admired the &#39;Declaration of Sentiments&#39;, published by the Seneca Falls Convention on women&#39;s rights, advocating for women&#39;s suffrage and became the first woman to register to vote in Concord, Massachusetts in a school board election. The 1850s were hard times for the Alcotts." />
