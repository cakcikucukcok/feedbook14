  <title>Percival, a Mouse in the President’S House - Rod Harrington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is Washington, August 24, 1814, and the presidents house is burning. Percival Mouse and his wife, Annie, have known for years this was coming, and they are not unprepared. They have risked everything to live in this time and place, hoping to save their present and future families. Their enemy, Balfour, a red dog of war, killed Percys father and has arrived with Admiral Cockburn, commander of the English troops, hoping to destroy the entire mouse family.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This is how life in the presidents house is for one mouse family. Rod Harringtons &lt;em&gt;Percival, a Mouse in the Presidents House&lt;/em&gt; combines fantasy and history to create an entertaining and interesting book. The Mouse family finds itself involved in historical events and close companions with many important historical figures of the times. Among them is Percivals friend, Benjamin Banneker, Americas first black man of science, who uses his knowledge of the universe and the physics of time travel for good, even from beyond his humble grave in Maryland. Readers will find themselves caught up in the history of the United States through the eyes and experiences of some of the countrys smallest citizens.&lt;/p&gt;" />
