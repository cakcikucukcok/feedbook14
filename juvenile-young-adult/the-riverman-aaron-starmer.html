      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Alistair Cleary is the kid who everyone trusts. Fiona Loomis is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; the typical girl next door. Alistair hasn&#39;t really thought of her since they were little kids until she shows up at his doorstep with a proposition: she wants him to write her biography. What begins as an odd vanity project gradually turns into a frightening glimpse into the mind of a potentially troubled girl. Fiona says that in her basement, there&#39;s a portal that leads to a magical world where a creature called the Riverman is stealing the souls of children. And Fiona&#39;s soul could be next. If Fiona really believes what she&#39;s saying, Alistair fears she may be crazy. But if it&#39;s true, her life could be at risk. In this novel from Aaron Starmer, it&#39;s up to Alistair to separate fact from fiction, fantasy from reality.&lt;/p&gt;" />
