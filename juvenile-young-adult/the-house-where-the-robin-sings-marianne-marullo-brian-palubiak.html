  <title>The House Where the Robin Sings - Marianne Marullo, Brian Palubiak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As a caregiver for over 20 years to my mother, writing stories became a way to escape into a world of make believe.  I have been asked &quot;How do you write a children&#39;s story?&quot; Well, you put your mind into that of a 10 year old child and write!  Since I have the brain of a 10 year old, it wasn&#39;t hard!
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I have always been a lover of animals and birds.  There wasn&#39;t a year I can remember that we didn&#39;t have a parakeet in the house.  That&#39;s because I was allergic to cats, long haired dogs and horses.  My dream of being a veterinarian was curtailed at a very early age, I can assure you.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I actually took up writing in 2005 with &quot;My Fine Feathered (and Furry) Friends&quot; (published by Publish America).  It was a humorous look at feeding the birds and animals where I work.  Since then I have been writing short animal stories and decided it was time for a children&#39;s book.  This book is the end result.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In the ever increasing &quot;electronic world&quot; we live in I believe there is still nothing better than curing up with a good book.  As a child, reading can make your imagination soar and take you places you&#39;ve never been before.  It did with me.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It is my hope that these stories will become favorites of you and your children.  If they make you giggle or just go &quot;Awww!&quot; my work is complete.  Please feel free to write to me at wildbirdy1@neo.rr.com.  I would love to hear from you." />
