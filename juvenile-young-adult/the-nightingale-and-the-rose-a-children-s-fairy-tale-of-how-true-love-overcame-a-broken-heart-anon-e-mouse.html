  <title>THE NIGHTINGALE AND THE ROSE - A Children’s fairy tale of how true love overcame a broken heart - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 364&lt;br /&gt;
In this 364th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the Fairy Tale &amp;quot;THE NIGHTINGALE AND THE ROSE&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
ONCE upon a time, long, long ago and far, far away, a nightingale sat in her nest watching and listening to the people below&amp;hellip; A young man was lamenting &amp;ldquo;She said that she would dance with me if I brought her red roses,&amp;rdquo; cried the young Student; &amp;ldquo;but in all my garden there is no red rose.&amp;rdquo; This got the nightingale wondering&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Here at last is a true lover,&amp;rdquo; said the Nightingale. &amp;ldquo;Night after night have I sung of him, though I knew him not: night after night have I told his story to the stars, and now I see him. His hair is dark as the hyacinth-blossom, and his lips are red as the rose of his desire; but passion has made his face like pale ivory, and sorrow has set her seal upon his brow.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;The Prince gives a ball to-morrow night,&amp;rdquo; murmured the young Student, &amp;ldquo;and my love will be of the company. If I bring her a red rose she will dance with me till dawn. If I bring her a red rose, I shall hold her in my arms, and she will lean her head upon my shoulder, and her hand will be clasped in mine. But there is no red rose in my garden, so I shall sit lonely, and she will pass me by. She will have no heed of me, and my heart will break.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;A true lover indeed,&amp;rdquo; said the Nightingale. &amp;ldquo;What I sing of, he suffers: what is joy to me, to him is pain. Surely Love is a wonderful thing. It is more precious than emeralds, and dearer than fine opals. Pearls and pomegranates cannot buy it, nor is it set forth in the market-place. It may not be purchased of the merchants, nor can it be weighed out in the balance for gold.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What did the nightingale do next you ask&amp;hellip;? Well many things happened, some strange, some silly and some serious. To find the answer to what happened to the young man and if he eventually danced with the woman of his dreams. And to find the any other questions you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
