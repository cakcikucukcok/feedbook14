  <title>Lost and Found - Barbara McClintock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When siblings Adèle and Simon visit their uncle in China, he buys them each gifts for their trip.  Simon picks out a hat, a flute, a fan, and other small items, while his sister selects a camera to photograph their journey. As soon as they&#39;re packed and ready, it&#39;s time to set off with Uncle Sydney to explore!  In a series of postcards home to their mother, Adèle describes each of the places they visit and the adventures they have... and, of course, what item Simon managed to lose at each stop along the way.  On a silk farm in Shanghai, he loses his scarf.  Along the Great Wall, his hat blows right off his head. By the end of the trip, Simon has misplaced all of his belongings!  But when Adèle develops her photographs, she and her brother discover that they can see each of Simon&#39;s lost items in the background of the pictures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barbara McClintock&#39;s meticulous research and intricate pen-and-ink and watercolor illustrations bring this book to life, capturing the essence of each of the culturally and historically significant sites that Adèle and Simon visit.  Children will love poring over the pictures to find Simon&#39;s lost items, and parents will value the authenticity of the art and story.&lt;/p&gt;" />
