  <title>The August 5 - Jenna Helland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In a world rocked by revolt, your worst enemy can become your greatest hope&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourteen-year-old Tommy Shore lives a life of privilege: he has the finest clothing, food, and education available and servants to take care of his every whim. He is the son of the chief administrator of Aeren-the most important man on the islands. Fifteen-year-old Tamsin Henry has grown up knowing only poverty, but she is the daughter of a revolutionary who longs to give her and their people more. &lt;br&gt;            Ordinarily, Tommy and Tamsin would never cross paths, but on the day of a violent and deadly revolt, chance brings them together. Now the world waits to hear the fate of the August 5, five men led by, and including, Tamsin&#39;s father and captured during the uprising. As tensions between the government and the rebels escalate, Tommy uncovers a brutal truth about his father. How will he ever get Tamsin to trust that he wants to help her cause, when she believes he stands for everything she&#39;s fighting against?&lt;/p&gt;" />
