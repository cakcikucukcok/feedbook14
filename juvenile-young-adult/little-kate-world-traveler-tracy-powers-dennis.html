  <title>Little Kate – World Traveler - Tracy Powers, Dennis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Papaw Estel, Grandma Hannahs husband of fifty years, passed away, she was left alone on her small farm to do the chores and reminisce about all the places she had wanted to travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kate, her twelve-year-old granddaughter, who had a close relationship with Grandma Hannah, steps in to fill the loneliness, help with the chores, and by traveling for her, shows her the world through the eyes of a child. 
&lt;p&gt;Dennis Powers and his wife, Tracy, have dedicated their lives to improving the human condition, Tracy as campus director for a community college; Dennis as an esteemed member of the Tennessee General Assembly. These life partners have combined their experiences and writing skills to pen Little KateWorld Traveler. I am hopeful that readers of the book, young and old, will be reminded that contributing to the happiness and well-being of others is paramount in the whole scheme of life.&lt;/p&gt;
