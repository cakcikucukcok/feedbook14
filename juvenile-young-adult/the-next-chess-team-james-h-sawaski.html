      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jim Berzchak has a brilliant mind for chess, yet nerves and fatigue stop his playing ambitions. Simply put, hes afraid to lose. However, from coaching his first team, the Escanaba Eskimos, he realizes there is security in numbers. Now employed as a small town high school teacher, he tries coaching again and is pleasantly surprised to have some girls on the chess team, something unheard of in the past. Everything goes great  for awhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mona Jones, the grandmother of one of the boys decides to take a more active role in the chess team. Her influence creates advantages for the boys. They become much stronger at the game than the girls. A rift develops  the boys become bullies  the team splits in two. Friends become bitter rivals  someone must lose. Jims fatigue is worse than ever. Other school activities and caring for his four year old son who cant speak yet drain his energy. He trains the girls for one last shot against Mona and the boys. Will he prove to everyone that girls really can play chess? Or will Mona and the boys capitalize on Jims fears and knock him out of chess forever? &lt;/p&gt;" />
