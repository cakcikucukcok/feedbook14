  <title>The Adventures of Jack and Gizmo - Frances Poulson, Dr. James S. Brown, Shari Campbell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the fifth in a new series of childrens books, The Adventures of Jack and Gizmo. These books are aimed specifically at primary school age boys. They are written based on the educational research into the factors that have been shown to play a role in increasing the probability that boys will develop an interest in reading at an early age.
Educational research has shown that the number one predictor that children will experience long-term success in school is the level of reading ability that they have by Grade Three. The research also shows that young boys that have been provided with books that have specific characteristics are likely to have a higher level of reading ability when they are in Grade Three. These characteristics are:
1.	Books that have a male as the central character;
2.	Books that the boys actually own, even if they cannot yet read them easily by themselves;
3.	Books that contain action, adventure and/or problem-solving by boys;
4.	Books that portray the central character modelling behaviours such as reading, problem-solving, and searching for and applying knowledge;
5.	Books in which the vocabulary allows them to be read to boys by their parents in their early years, and by the boys themselves once they begin to read for themselves." />
