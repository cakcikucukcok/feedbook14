  <title>The Miraculous - Jess Redman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;An Amazon Best Children&#39;s Book of 2019&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;In the tradition of heartwrenching and hopeful middle grade novels such as &lt;i&gt;Bridge to Terabithia &lt;/i&gt;comes Jess Redman&#39;s stunning debut about a young boy who must regain his faith in miracles after a tragedy changes his world.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Eleven-year-old Wunder Ellis is a miracologist. In a journal he calls &lt;i&gt;The Miraculous&lt;/i&gt;, he records stories of the inexplicable and the extraordinary. And he believes every single one. But then his newborn sister dies, at only eight days old. If that can happen, then miracles can&#39;t exist. So Wunder gets rid of &lt;i&gt;The Miraculous. &lt;/i&gt;He stops believing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then he meets Faye--a cape-wearing, outspoken girl with losses of her own. Together, they find an abandoned house by the cemetery and a mysterious old woman who just might be a witch. The old woman asks them for their help. She asks them to believe. And they go on a journey that leads to friendship, to adventure, to healing--and to miracles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Miraculous &lt;/i&gt;is Jess Redman&#39;s sparkling debut novel about facing grief, trusting the unknown, and finding brightness in the darkest moments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;A stunning story expressing the complexities and mysteries of love and death in all of its light and darkness. A beautifully rendered and meaningful read for young readers asking deep questions.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Veera Hiranandani, Newbery Honor-winning author of &lt;/i&gt;The Night Diary&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Exquisitely crafted, serious, yet woven through with wry humor, this story&#39;s miracles are its fierce and tender characters. I loved this extraordinary debut.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Leslie Connor, National Book Award Finalist author of &lt;/i&gt;The Truth as Told by Mason Buttle&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This title has common core connections&lt;/p&gt;" />
