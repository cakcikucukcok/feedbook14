  <title>The Quest for the Hidden Medallion - Michael Smits</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When the Blish family decided to move from California to Grandpa and Grandmas farm in northeast Wisconsin, the children thought it was the most boring place in the entire world. Emily, Anthony, and Margaret wanted a real adventure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No adventure could be found until they met Mr. Pippin. He sent them on many wonderful make-believe adventures. When tragedy struck Mr. Pippin, he left them with the greatest adventure of all. What was the mystery he was hiding? What was this medallion all about? Why did they have to find it? Would they ever be able to reach it with all the dangers lurking around every corner?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Blish children begin to learn the lessons of faith and trust in God as they travel through this new adventure. They wanted to have the kind of faith that their parents and grandparents had, but it was hard for them because they were just kids. Now, on their own and relying on the examples set by their family, they put to practice what they had learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the time came for the children to confront the enemy, they were ready to trust God for help.&lt;/p&gt;" />
