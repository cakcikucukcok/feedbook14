  <title>The Mystery of the Broomstick Horse - Linda J. Dalton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The family moved from New England not long ago.  In Wyoming, Karah found that she loves sunrises, horses and adventure. The Knowles family purchased the old Summers Hill Ranch, which is surrounded by the mountains and the Wind River Reservation.  In those hills Karah and her friend pursue adventures daily. Her parents never know just what Karah and Morning Star will be bringing home next.
	Returning home after a day seeking antlers and arrowheads, Black Jack spooked on something hidden in the sage. Karah tried to urge him ahead, without success. Upon closer inspection she saw what resembled a ragged broomstick. She struggled to remove it from the sage and discovered that it was a horse  a broomstick horse. She hurriedly tied it to her saddle, then she and Black Jack high-tailed it for home.
	Dad, thinking it might be an Indian thing, advised her that she might consult Morning Stars grandfather. After supper, Karah found that the little horse, which had been left in the mudroom, had miraculously disappeared!
	This story unfolds as a series of tasks must be accomplished before the Little Horse can be set free. The girls entrust Twisted Hair with events that have happened in the past and will happen in the future.
	This book will hold your interest, and you will find that you cannot wait to turn to the next page. I hope that you will enjoy reading my Mystery of the Broomstick Horse." />
