She&#39;s been assigned a job, Soul Catcher, and a teacher, Bodhi, a possibly cute, seemingly nerdy boy who&#39;s definitely hiding something. They return to earth together for Riley&#39;s first assignment, a Radiant Boy who&#39;s been haunting a castle in England for centuries. Many Soul Catchers have tried to get him to cross the bridge and failed. But all of that was before he met Riley . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Radiance &lt;/i&gt;is the first book in the Riley Bloom series from bestselling author Alyson Noël.&lt;/p&gt;" />
