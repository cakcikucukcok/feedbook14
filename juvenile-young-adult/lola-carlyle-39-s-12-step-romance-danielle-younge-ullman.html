  <title>Lola Carlyle&#39;s 12-Step Romance - Danielle Younge-Ullman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lola Carlyle is lonely, out of sorts, and in for a boring summer. So when her best friend, Sydney, calls to rave about her stay at a posh Malibu rehab and reveals that the love of Lola&#39;s life, Wade Miller, is being admitted, she knows what she has to do. Never mind that her worst addiction is decaf cappuccino; Lola is going to rehab. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lola arrives at Sunrise Rehab intent solely on finding Wade, saving him from himself, and-naturally-making him fall in love with her...only to discover she&#39;s actually expected to be an addict. And get treatment. And talk about her issues with her parents, and with herself. Plus she has insane roommates, and an irritatingly attractive mentor, Adam, who&#39;s determined to thwart her at every turn.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, and Sydney? She&#39;s gone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turns out, once her pride, her defenses, and her best friend are stripped away, Lola realizes she&#39;s actually got a lot to overcome...if she can open her heart long enough to let it happen.&lt;/p&gt;" />
