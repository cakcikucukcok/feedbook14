  <title>Awakened - P. C. Cast, Kristin Cast</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;My love, speak to me.  Tell me everything.&quot;  Neferet went to Kalona, kneeling before him, stroking the soft, dark wings that unfurled loosely around the immortal. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;What would you have me say?&quot;  He didn&#39;t meet her eyes.  &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt; &quot;Zoey lives.&quot; Neferet&#39;s voice was flat, cold, lifeless.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;She does.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Then you owe me the subservience of your immortal soul.&quot;  She started to walk away from him.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Where are you going?  What will happen next?&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt; &quot;It is quite simple.  I will ensure Zoey is drawn back to Oklahoma.  There, on my own terms, I will complete the task you failed.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exonerated by the Vampyre High Council and returned to her position of High Priestess at Tulsa&#39;s House of Night, Neferet has sworn vengeance on Zoey.  Dominion over Kalona is only one of the weapons she plans to use against Z.  But Zoey has found sanctuary on the Isle of Skye and is being groomed by Queen Sgiach to take over for her there.  Being Queen would be cool, wouldn&#39;t it?  Why should she return to Tulsa? After losing her human consort, Heath, she will never be the same - and her relationship with her super-hot-warrior, Stark, may never be the same either...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And what about Stevie Rae and Rephaim?  The Raven Mocker refuses to be used against Stevie Rae, but what choice does he have when no one in the entire world, including Zoey, would be okay with their relationship?  Does he betray his father or his heart?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the pulse-pounding 8th book in the bestselling House of Night series, how far will the bonds of friendship stretch and how strong are the ties that bind one girl&#39;s heart?&lt;/p&gt;" />
