  <title>Girls Guitars Gatling Guns - Jimmy Boom Semtex</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A new collection by Jimmy Boom Semtex. This book contains varied work on many topics. From a spaceship shaped like a horse (Aerospace Grade Materials), what to do with a body (The Human Body), satire about human waste (Turd People), about the 4th Reich (She Asks), drug war stories (A Mother&#39;s Tale) and much more.    Jimmy&#39;s troubled teen years are covered here (No Teen Gal, Days of Thunder and You Did).  Fans of his work and explosive writing style won&#39;t be disappointed.  Sample:  Etched in Bombs Post me a letter bomb to blow me up. Reduce me to pieces for I&#39;ve had enough. The biggest bit of me, my thumb. Look at it just sitting there, on the floor. I&#39;m like strawberry jam, all over the walls. Best way to be in this selfish money grabbing world, dead. Blown up like those stuck in Aleppo. Blitzed by Putin&#39;s bombs in the world&#39;s weapon proving ground." />
