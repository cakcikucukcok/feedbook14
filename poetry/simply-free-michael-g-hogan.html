  <title>Simply Free - Michael G. Hogan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Michael Hogan started writing, he never set out to pen a poetry collection. He simply told stories of his dad and, over time, the stories became confessionals in rhyme. Watching someone suffer through the terrible disease of alcoholism taught Michael many life lessonsones he never wanted to learn. The only way to exorcise those old demons was to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply Free is a collection of words that ring true to any child, spouse, or family member of an addict. In Somethings Wrong, Dad, he gives voice to a childs fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who are you, Dad? You change too much&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like when you drink, is that your crutch?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whats in the bottle you crave so dearly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesnt help me see you clearly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I pray, I pray for things to turn&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steady my mind from the churn&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only my dad controls the change&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please, Dad, dont be so strange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dedicated to his dad, Simply Free flowed much easier than Michael originally expected. He believed sharing his thoughts and feelings would be unsettlinginstead, the poems set him free. Through words happy and sad, read of hope postaddiction and the love of a child for his father.&lt;/p&gt;" />
