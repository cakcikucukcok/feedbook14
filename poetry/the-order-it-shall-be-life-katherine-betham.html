  <title>“The Order It Shall Be, Life” - Katherine Betham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Katherine Betham is a new Author with the release of her first Poetry Classique, The Order it shall Be, LIFE.  Katherine is a New Zealand born Samoan Woman and Mother of four children, Liam (19) Jamie (17), Blaine (11) and Elyse (9 years).  Katherine was born at Wellington Hospital on the 24th August 1970.  She is the 10th child born of 12 children to Burton Cubitt and Elsie Betham.  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My parents were born and raised in Western Samoa; My Mum comes from Malifa and Dad from Matautu-uta, Apia, Samoa.  They migrated to New Zealand in the early 1950s for work; they met in New Zealand (though they knew each other from School in Samoa).  They were married in the late 1950s and settled in Porirua on Astrolabe Street where they raised their 12 Children and still reside their today.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Katherine shares her Spiritual Journey of LIFE,  a tapestry of Love, Children, Family, Motivation, Infidelity and Anger.  The Authors words weave raw and realistic insight into isssues that Katherine has personally overcome.  She is descriptive, Passionate and Speaks from the Heart 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
Themes of Gratitude and God are all encased in her literature  She also shares Poetry of Self-Motivation and Self Belief; it is an honest depiction of the Authors Life forever moving forward  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Life is so not perfect, but it gets better every day in every way and for that I am Grateful&quot;. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Katherine shares a poem from her Grandfather  Henry Betham, titled - Home.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  
My Grandfather was born in Falealili, Samoa on the 27.07.1902 and died on the 23.08.1980  Matautu-uta, Samoa.  Katherine features a Life Portrait of her Great, Great Grandfather  Frederick Betham, born on the 13.07.1791, Stonham Aspall, Suffolk.  She dedicates all the English Art Pieces featured in the book to the Journey of her Great, Great Grandfather Frederick as without him we would not have the Betham (F.H.W.E.) Family line in Western Samoa and New Zealand.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Katherine Celebrates 10 Years, on the 8th September 2013 as a Single Mother and Woman.  She dedicates 2 of Tupac Shakurs Poems to her estranged partner of 13 years and Father to her 4 Children, J.T.  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;I dedicate 2 of my favourite poems to the positive side of our past relationship and that is for the Duel love of our 4 children, Literature, Art and Music...  
No regrets J.T we lived loved and have four beautiful children together &quot;." />
