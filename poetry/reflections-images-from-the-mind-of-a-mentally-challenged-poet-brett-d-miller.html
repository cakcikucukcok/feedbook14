  <title>Reflections: Images From The Mind Of A Mentally Challenged Poet - Brett D. Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a very creative testimony of poetic art from Mr. Miller&#39;s first years as a poet in sixth grade to this present day. Mr. Miller, like an artist uses paint to create a beautiful picture on a canvas, uses words to paint pictures in people&#39;s minds. His many friends and family have loved and raved over his works of literary art, even including one of his best friends, actress and director Courteney Cox who recently said, &quot;I applaud the words in this lovely collection of poems.&quot; Whether you&#39;re buying this book for yourself, for family member, or for a friend, after reading it for the first time, you&#39;ll want to read it again and again while definitely agreeing that Mr. Miller&#39;s style of poetry, which shows the combination of a strong, spiritual force in both his struggles as a Christian and his Godly inspiration as illustrated by his poems in this book, is such a force to be reckoned with in the world of literary artists while thus certainly earning him the title, &quot;The Poet Of Mountain Brook!&quot;" />
