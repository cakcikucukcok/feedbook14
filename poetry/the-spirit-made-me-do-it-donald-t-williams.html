  <title>The Spirit Made Me Do It - Donald T. Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Spirit Made Me Do It&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Difficult life lessons learned the hard way made simpler via God&#39;s way&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would have, could have, should have were all I could come up with after I finally got around to reading the Bible midway through my fifty-eighth year of life. Being a retired English teacher, I have read my share of fine novels, short stories, plays, poems and letters over the years, each with its premise, lesson or moral. But the Bible, the most important literary work of all. I had deliberately avoided. I reasoned that &quot;not knowing&quot; would somehow diminish my accountability for the flaws of my imperfect existence. Ignorance was almost bliss for a while.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cop out was working just fine for me until life threw me a succession of 140 mph fast and curve balls. I got beamed something fierce, but it knocked some much needed sense into me. Yes, there was a weighty price for my knowledgeable ignorance, but I believe I know that I&#39;m better for it. So, look at me now....spreading the &quot;good news&quot; in the only humble way I know how. Who would have ever thought? The Holy Spirit? Only God knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do hope that you enjoy reading these verses and consider them heaven sent as I certainly do. It&#39;s the only way I can account for something or someone, God Almighty. The Spirit Made Me Do It.&lt;/p&gt;" />
