  <title>Pandora&#39;s Box - Jack Henry Markowitz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Book Summary
With the publication of Pandoras Box  New Collected Poems the author presents a collection of his more recently written poems. This new volume can be viewed as a book end to his prior collection Please Ask, Do Tell  The Collected Poems which represents a collection of some of his favorite poems that were written over a span of 40 years.
In his novella Stuff Happens author Jack Henry Markowitz combines elements of fiction and non fiction in a new form he calls Friction - a combination of the fictitious with the real. In The Practice and Other Stories he writes short stories with satiric wit and Jewish humor about working class New York characters he had observed during his growing-up years. With the publication of Bubbie and Zadie Save the Day Markowitz retells a Romanian folk tale that his mother often told to him and his siblings as a rather unusual bed time story
The author resides in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where he continues to work and write. See links for more information: www.jhmcommunications.com; http://jckmrkwtz.blogspot.com." />
