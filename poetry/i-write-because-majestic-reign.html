  <title>I Write Because..... - Majestic Reign</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I Write Because.....A Foster Child&#39;s Blues is a follow up book to Walking in Rhythm. A second compilation of poetry both new and old works from Majestic personal collection. This book shows a more political vision and an amazing out-take on life. Not every poem in the book represents Majestic life growing up. However, it does represent a circle of life. Realizing that we all go through turmoil and trials and at the end of it all the verdict seems to be on the right side. Pushing passed the pain we regain subtle to our happiness. I Write Because isnt just about one main thing but, about many unwinding roads we travel. The love for family even though we can get hurt by them, we still fight for love. Growing outside ourselves just so we can take a deeper look inside. Our morals and child like wishes and dying just so we can live. I write because my mind wont let my hand not, because, every time I see my daughter she reminds me to be inspired, there is always a story to be told. Writing to paint a picture with our imagination. Upon reading dig a little deeper and just imagine. I write because I love it." />
