  <title>The Supper Club - Justin Thadd Kludzinski, Marie Lottie Kludzinski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Biography of Justin Thadd Kludzinski
&lt;p&gt;I was born in a small section of a big city of Chicago on the south side called the Bush on May 5, 1952. The area was near the steel plant where my Dad worked as a welder. The 1950s Chicago was divided in complete ethnic districts and ours was Polish. I went to St. Michaels Grammar school.  Ever since I was small I made friends fast. If I were to start a gang, I would probably have over a million members by now. I always was a leader, and I came up with new games and things to do as a kid. I listened well and tried to always stay in at a glass half full mentality. I went to CVS high school where I learned electronics which helped me when I was in the Army. I did very well, and I became the 32G20 fix crypto Pro from Dover.  I got additional specialty pay and the pay was good an extra $50.00 a month. I then got married to my beautiful fiance Maria and had two great kids Jessica and Matthew. I was really sick in 1993 with AML. I learned to see people more as individuals and that made me a better person. I wrote The Array for the people to continue to support the USA, and to hold firm in their belief in God after 9/11.&lt;/p&gt;" />
