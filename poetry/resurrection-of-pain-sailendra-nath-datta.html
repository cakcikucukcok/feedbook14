  <title>Resurrection of Pain - Sailendra Nath Datta</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the first book of English poems of the new poet written for the international readers. He has often been obsessed by the myriad facets of life, particularly the sad and sordid ones, which continually torment him. He cannot forget the pain emanating from his inner soul, reminding him of his ineffective poetic urge to remedy some of the ills inflicting mankind as a whole. He is often haunted by a traditional saying or universal wisdom or a catchy idea, and develops his poem to a conclusion. Sometimes, it seems, he has deviated from his main theme. But, actually, he has a definite frame of mind, which leads his poem to a natural growth. His treatment of a poem has been as simple as can be, with a plain variety of language and imagery, although used to a minimum. What has enriched his poetry is his philosophical content, apparent or hidden. Actually, what moves him throughout is his feelings and experience of different sorts of pains he has undergone during his past and which still bubble up to remind him of their existence. His experiences of pleasures and joy are very few but enable him endure woes and worries of life. With this background in mind, the readers may proceed to enjoy a new kind of poetry in the following pages." />
