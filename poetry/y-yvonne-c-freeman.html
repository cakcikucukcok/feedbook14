  <title>Y - Yvonne C. Freeman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Y (Spiritual Journey) is a book of spiritual poems that explore an array of human emotions and experiences.  For some of you, it is a reflection in the mirror to your soul.  For others, it reveals stories you have lived, lingering memories of silent struggles from within. But for all, its intent is to provide insight, inspiration and hope.  God is the rock and the foundation of every poem.  He is the way, the truth and the light, who will guide you on your journey through this life.&lt;P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; Many of the poems like, Hold On, I Cry and Why? are two pages long because the spiritual messages they convey cannot be told in a couple of paragraphs.  There are several other poems in this book you will find of interest, such as: Pennies From Heaven, Walk With Me Lord, Dont Give Up, Gods Canvas In the Sky, He Never Promised Us Tomorrow, I Call Your Name, After the Storm and Joy Comes in the Morning. To order, just click on the shopping cart. &lt;P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;Click on Author Display, located on the left hand side of this page to read my biography.  If you have enjoyed any of these poems, please share this website with your friends and family.  Click on Contact Author.  Id love to hear from you.  As one of the poems said, &lt;B&gt;&quot;Pass It On&quot;&lt;B&gt;.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The book is also available at &lt;A href= &quot;http://www.amazon.com/Spiritual-Journey-Yvonne-C-Freeman/dp/143630623X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1220377553&amp;sr=1-1&quot;&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/A&gt;, &lt;A href= &quot;http://www.borders.com/online/store/SearchResults?title=Y%3A+Spiritual+Journey&amp;type=1&amp;fromHeader=2&quot;&gt;Borders.com&lt;/A&gt;, and &lt;A href= &quot;http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Y/Yvonne-C-Freeman/e/9781436306232/?itm=1&quot;&gt;BarnesandNoble.com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/P&gt; 
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Commentaries from my readers:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;P&gt; &quot;This subtle poetry jumps off the pages and into our hearts.  Each poem creatively breaths life into us by granting a glimpse of how we can better live our lives and in so doing, create good spaces for ourselves and those we share our lives with.  Yvonnes book is truly inspirationally uplifting and life changing.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Stephanie Sanford&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; &quot;This exhilarating book of poems will take you on an adventure filled with biblical truths.  From Genesis to Revelation this book of poetry will take your mind through a wonderful and glorious journey.  So sit back and enjoy and get ready to be filled with spiritual exuberance.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
