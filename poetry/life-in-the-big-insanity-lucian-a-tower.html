  <title>Life in the Big Insanity - Lucian A. Tower</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I began writing song lyrics, short stories, and
poetry some 48-years-ago. While I was in high
school, during the 60s, I had the privilege of
meeting Poet Laureate of the United States of
America, Mr. Robert Frost. He spoke with me
discussing my writings, my poetry. He told me
to keep writing and reading, and as I continued
I would learn so much more, and eventually
become a published poet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I have continued writing lyrics, short
stories, and poetry. I am now 63-years-old,
and I have been published. I have always told
other poets and writers to keep on writing, and learning about the many different
styles of the written arts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I have also spent 35-years as an entertainer, singer, song writer, and also a
musician. I have worked with Tom T. Hall, Billy Jo Spears, Red Sovine, Bobby
Bare, and Kitty Wells. I have also played with Rhythm Blues Entertainers too, The
Four Tops, The Platters, The Shrills, and Visions ( Mark Farner, of Grand Funk
Railroad, and the survivors of the Lynard Skynard Band). We were an International
Country Rhythm Blues Band, and played together for several years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The way I see writing poetry is a likeness to a photograph of a moment, a
dream, a place, a thing, a memory. Life comes at us in many ways, sometimes
in many different ways at once. Its the situations that arise, the masks some
people wear, the way they talk and rub shoulders with everybody. These things
make up the poetry I write. When you sit down and look at life youll find its
much bigger than just us. This is poetry, lyric writing, short stories, journalism,
actually all the arts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I have found all things good in writing, even when Im turned down by an
editor. Its all learning, and enjoying what I do. I choose a photograph, a moment,
a dream, or a situation and I write about it. I create a picture with words. I live
a simple life as a disabled veteran of the U.S.M.C., and of the Vietnam War.
However, I am simply me, and I dont try and say Im someone else. Who am I?
Well Im a human being who loves the arts. My message to you all who reads this
is KEEP ON WRITING, KEEP ON KEEPING ON." />
