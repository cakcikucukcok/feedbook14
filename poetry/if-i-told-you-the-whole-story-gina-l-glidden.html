  <title>If I Told You the Whole Story - Gina L. Glidden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;If I Told You the Whole Story presents an inspiring collection of poetry written from the heart by Gina Glidden. She shares her poems with the hope that others may be inspired and be able to connect with the sentiments in her poetry. She seeks to express her feelings and to find peace and relaxation in her life. From the feelings of the loss of a loved one expressed in Time Does Not Pass to the joy of being a mother she shares in Your Mommy and Your Friend, Glidden digs deep into the emotions that give our lives meaning.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If I Told You the Whole Story provides an opportunity to ponder the gifts that life has given to each of us and the hope of the future that awaits us.&lt;/P&gt;
Eyes of Charm&lt;/br&gt;
Eyes of charm to look upon,&lt;/br&gt;
The gentle ways I have.&lt;/br&gt;
A heart of gold brazening&lt;/br&gt;
The love that keeps me glad.&lt;/br&gt;
A time with you, for which I pray;&lt;/br&gt;
To see the ways of love,&lt;/br&gt;
And time for me eternally,&lt;/br&gt;
Which then would be quite enough.&lt;/br&gt;
The battles have been won and fought,&lt;/br&gt;
For thou has come today,&lt;/br&gt;
The Holy Lord of loving thought,&lt;/br&gt;
To whisk my soul away.&lt;/br&gt;" />
