      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If I had but one wish to be fulfilled, it would be that I could be happy always. Do you ever ask yourself, Why am I here? Who am I? What is my purpose? Be assured you are not alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some people are happy to settle for the comfortable, routine path through life, others of us find that path simply unacceptable. True happiness is as varied as there are those to experience it; the challenge lies in allowing ourselves the chance to seek it out. In Lessons in Life: Travelling through the Colours of the Rainbow, author and world traveller Deborah J Weston leads us on a journey of self-discoverya search for our own sense of purpose and for the answers to our questions about love, life, happiness, fate and consequence.&lt;/p&gt;" />
