  <title>Fuckin&#39; Poetry - Roland Frye</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fuckin Poetry: Haiku for the Bipolar is a look into the mind of
one average man and his struggle with bipolar disorder. The
author originally chose to write poetry in the form of haiku, as a
therapeutic method of dealing with his disorder. However, the
author found himself in the middle of Axis I teetering between
moments of mania, depression and anxiety. As one will see, the
authors journey begins with a reflection upon family and leading
into a spiraling life and death struggle of losing friends to drugs
and suicide. The author deals with the stigmata of bipolar disorder
and stamped 296 (the beginning of the DSM diagnostic codes for
bipolar disorder) by trying to embrace the world around him and
telling it to fuck off at the same time. The author chooses to write
about his experiences as impressionist painting of a life in hope
that others with this will overcome their fears in others to find their
own form of art as a means of articulating to the outside world what
is bottled up inside. In a world where one foot is always hanging
over the edge, the author hopes that Fuckin Poetry will help others
find a way to cope with their disorder." />
