  <title>Ee-Ore&#39;s - Leonard Veddar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="February 19, 2011 
Leonard was born to a life few would appreciate on December 25th, 1936 in Cour d&#39;elene Idaho . His mother died when he was 2  years old, shortly after her death, Leonard along with his sister Marxine were sent to live with their Grandparents. They lived on a farm and took care of horses. milked cows, and put up loose hay. At a young age he learned the importance of being responsible and significance of family. Just like we have always heard, he would ride a sled six miles downhill to school in the mornings then walk the six miles back up the hill after school in the afternoons. If he was lucky, he could sometimes get a sleigh ride back up the hill. Those close to him knew this story well. While attending the one room school, his teachers thought he was so smart they twice moved him forward a grade." />
