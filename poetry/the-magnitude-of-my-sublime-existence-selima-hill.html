  <title>The Magnitude of My Sublime Existence - Selima Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Magnitude of My Sublime Existence&lt;/i&gt; is the account of a young woman&#39;s stay in the psychiatric ward of a large hospital. The only time she feels safe is when swimming; the only place, the sea, preferably underwater. Selima Hill&#39;s 17th book of poetry – her 14th from Bloodaxe – takes her back to the territory of her third book, &lt;i&gt;The Accumulation of Small Acts of Kindness&lt;/i&gt; (1983), but this revisiting is quite different in style and mood. Over thirty years later, &#39;this brilliant lyricist of human darkness&#39; (Fiona Sampson) is more able to chart and illuminate &#39;extreme experience with a dazzling excess&#39; (Deryn Rees-Jones), with startling humour and surprising combinations of homely and outlandish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;Arguably the most distinctive truth teller to emerge in British poetry&amp;hellip;Despite her thematic preoccupations, there&#39;s nothing conscientious or worthy about Hill&#39;s work. She is a flamboyant, exuberant writer who seems effortlessly to juggle her outrageous symbolic lexicon&amp;hellip;using techniques of juxtaposition, interruption and symbolism to articulate narratives of the unconscious. Those narratives are the matter of universal, and universally recognisable, psychodrama&amp;hellip;hers is a poetry of piercing emotional apprehension, lightly worn&amp;hellip; So original that it has sometimes scared off critical scrutineers, her work must now, surely, be acknowledged as being of central importance in British poetry – not only for the courage of its subject matter but also for the lucid compression of its poetics&#39; – Fiona Sampson, &lt;i&gt;Guardian&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#39;Hill, more than any other English poet, cranks out angry, impotent, abused and richly surreal Britain.
