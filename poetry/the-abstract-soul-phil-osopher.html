  <title>The Abstract Soul - Phil Osopher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hello, my name is Philip R. Richards, the author of this book.
I suppose you want to know something about the word smith that 
created these writings. Oh, this is my friend Harry pictured with 
me. He has passed now, but he will always be in our hearts.
 I was born in 1959, I enjoy photography and the natural world. 
I married a wonderful woman in 1983 and had two beautiful
daughters, Hannah and Allison. I am blessed with a wonderful 
Granddaughter named Lillian Jade. We live in the Michigan, 
the winter wonderland. It is a beautiful state with much to explore. 
 I discovered that I really enjoyed writing. Mostly I feel a need to 
write, to express how I view different aspects of life and to try to 
relate to other people with similar visions and view points.
 Writing is a great way to express your feelings and create an 
avenue between you and those around you. 
 I hope you can relate to what I have written in this book, 
maybe enough to get Book II, when I get around to it." />
