  <title>then/again - Michelle Elrick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Michelle Elrick&#39;s &lt;i&gt;then/again&lt;/i&gt; is a poetic account of finding home, and the meanings and moments that the concept of home can come to embody. The collection tracks the poet through a landscape of intimate places-an ancestral home in Scotland, a mother&#39;s birthplace in Salzburg, a childhood home on the West Coast-as well as the memory-warped terrain of the poet&#39;s past houses.  In brief poetic capsules that combine to form long, lyrical narratives, Elrick enfolds layers of tactile and remembered experience, offering continual moments of surprise. In the observer&#39;s eye, the double act of perceiving and writing lends transformative and mythic properties to the everyday: &quot;a heron drums a pattern of shadows on the surface of the sea, wings tick with quartz regularity. bay clouds spot red, bulbs of peach bloom, smoulder and die down into blue.&quot; The collection is infused by a sense of nostalgia and longing within the present moment, illustrating the elusiveness of home even while it is being lived: &quot;I watch as the day opens, expanding its geometry. diffuse light penetrates the blind. hot sun yellows cold concrete (caress stretching across the courtyard).&quot;  Each quiet moment of reflection builds upon the others to produce a sense of place that is as immediate and fleeting as home itself. Elrick has an uncanny sense for capturing and illuminating those moments that will later glow in memory." />
