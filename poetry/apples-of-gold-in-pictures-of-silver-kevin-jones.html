  <title>Apples of Gold in Pictures of Silver - Kevin Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is the most extraordinary, unique, and heartfelt book you will ever read. It is the true life experience of Kevin written in poetic format. It is a story of love and pain, street life, and crime. The author tells of his ups and downs and struggles and triumphs, even his deepest, darkest secrets. Hes a very spiritual person, so he talks a lot about spirituality and belief and truth as well as disbelief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can profoundly feel not only the authors pain but also his sense of determination to overcome his hardships and struggles. It is his hope, prayer, and more sincere wish that this book will genuinely help you and that through his own trials and tribulations, you will not only see his growth and development but that you will also take a look in the mirror. In doing so, try to reflect on your life and how youre living, knowing that one wrong decision could not only affect you for years to come but can also affect the people that love you or profess to love you the most. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apples of Gold in Pictures of Silver will keep you intrigued and eager to turn each page. It is a brilliant, beautifully written book that is the beginning of a legacy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
