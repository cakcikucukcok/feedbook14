      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Writing is a skill that no one can live without. Practicing and learning to write is very diffi cult, even more so when writing is just for a grade. Boredom sets in when students realize that their only audience is the teacher - again! The writing in this book was not graded. This book is the authentic writing of eighth grade students that were given only one direction, write about something you care about. Some authors write from the depths of their hearts, some share wicked humor, while others refl ect their loyalty to family or to friends. They wrote, rewrote, read with peers and helped one another. It is all their work, in their words, in their own unique perspective. Hopefully, these young writers will always remember that what they have to say is important and that they truly are published authors. Celebrate these writers - enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;" />
