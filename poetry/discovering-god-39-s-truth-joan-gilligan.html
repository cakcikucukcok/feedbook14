  <title>Discovering God&#39;s Truth - Joan Gilligan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If you struggle in your faith walk or lack victory over sinful habits, Discovering Gods Truth will bring personal revival to you. It will wet your appetite to taste and see that the Lord is good. That God understands us and wants to bring us into a closer relationship with Him is a theme that comes like crashing waves upon the shore of the readers mind. You will learn how the enemy has deceived mankind and how to overcome temptation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The messages are written as poetry in a style that is easy to read, but the depth of commitment to Gods will is apparent from the first poem to the last. Whether you are still on the sidelines of believing or you are a mature believer, this book will grip your mind and heart to put God first in your life. For a fire of love and passion for God burns in these messages that will warm the coldest heart. Fellowship with all three persons of the Godhead will deepen as you read the book. The reader will learn the importance of prayer, meditating on Gods Word and how to walk by faith and deny the flesh. Putting on the mind of Christ and being empowered by the Spirit are truths taught in these messages. Readers will gain wisdom and strength to live victoriously in the midst of trials, praising and thanking God because of His presence in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
