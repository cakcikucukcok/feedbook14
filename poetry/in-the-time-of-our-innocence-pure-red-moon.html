  <title>In the Time of Our Innocence Pure - Red Moon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book started with a simple poem;or the writing of a few ideas around the 4th of July
2010. This is a pleasant time of year in America and got things going in the right direction.
Soon,as the year progressed,more and more events shaped occurrences and this book began
to take on a life of its own. In short,it was the right time for me to embark on this project
and am happy with its outcome. These poems explore the edge,of modern life with a core of
traditionalism. I only hope that the world enjoys reading them as much as I enjoyed putting
them down on paper. I am also hoping to do some good with this book and have decided to
donate half of the proceeds to disaster relief. It has been an epic year of natural disasters,and
many peoples lives have been affected by tornados, hurricanes,flooding,earthquakes and
wildfires. If this book raises funds I will be looking to help those families who are still
rebuilding. L.O.L&lt;/p&gt;" />
