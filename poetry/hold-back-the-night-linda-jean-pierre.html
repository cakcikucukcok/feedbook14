  <title>Hold Back the Night - Linda Jean-Pierre</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book represents a collection of original poetry by the author.  It&#39;s about life and survival. What doesn&#39;t kill you makes you stronger.  We&#39;ve all heard that before. But if you can truly go through a struggle and come out better, not bitter, you have won that battle.  And, in life there are many battles! 
Hold Back The Night is about struggles, about change, about overcoming, growth, betrayals, heartaches, but most of all, surviving them all.  You may shed a tear, smile, feel the pain of late night tears or the joy of waking up the next morning, knowing that daybreak has come and you didn&#39;t succumb to the night, the dark time.  There are times when we feel like we&#39;ve had enough, like the sorrow or pain will never end. But time keeps marching and as we go through life, we truly look back and wonder how we made it through.  
Life lessons are learned, to be a blessing to others, to have a testimony, to encourage someone that may feel lost that if I can go through what I went through and didn&#39;t lose my mind, so can you.  Life lessons are a given, it teaches us.  We must learn from them. There are generations coming after us, our children and childrens&#39; children, what legacy or strength will we leave behind.  Our mothers and fathers have taught us that the sun will shine again, if we hold on.  The darkest hour truly is just before day.  If we hold on and faint not, everything will be alright.  For if the Lord takes us today, the sun will still rise tomorrow. There is always hope." />
