  <title>Splash - Maggie Bruehl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Splash: Capturing Moments in Time has been fun for me to read. I love how Maggie takes everyday experiences, gleans deeper meaning and expresses it in beautiful words. My favorite is Shoes. Take the time to read through this treasure
and find your favorite. 
--- Judy Douglass, Cru writer, speaker and encourager&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In Splash, Maggie Bruehl completes a labor of love and invites us to wander through word pictures and powerful personal moments. Her poems flow from Scripture, family, friends, and cancer in this open and beautiful collection of poems.&quot; 
Robert W. Kimsey, Blue Ridge Poets and Writers; author of Air Swimmer&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our family has had its own struggles with suffering, so I connect with Maggie&#39;s journey of faith. As she expresses my own thoughts and feelings in her poetry, she inspires me to articulate for myself new ways of thinking about my journey
and that of my family. I especially loved &#39;Sand In My Shoes.&#39;&quot; 
Karon Morton, VP InterVarsity Christian Fellowship/USA&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capturing time through poetry, Maggie Bruehl invites you to come with her through reflections from the Bible and everyday life, where things as simple as cleaning silver or being stranded on the side of the road evoke poems. Life is reflected in relationships, and with distinct candor, Maggie exposes her own failures, inspiration, and joy.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life also contains suffering. An incurable form of cancer has forced Maggie to face fears of death and live each day fully. Splash: Captured Moments in Time invites you on a journey, reconnecting with your own most personal, inspiring and lasting moments.&lt;p&gt;" />
