  <title>Beauteous Be Poesy - Stacey Law</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This poetry book is an anthology of beautiful poetics. It creates insights on various topics and nature. All poesies are of creative writing style and come to a well-rounded conclusion. There are several on roses, and I hope all the topics will encourage your love of poems as well as I love writing it. Enlisting the mind with the power of words bring you through a journey of pretty poetics.
As you glance and perceive the ability to appreciate poesy, this anthology will intrigue your mind and also create an aura of the element of surprise in endings and will capture your mind to both think and enjoy the writing of pretty words and view a true poet. Some are imaginary, influencing your brain to stimulate a mental picture and intrigue your IQ. The aura captured, but the words can psychologically have you perceiving a whole new attitude in life. Ive taken three majors in college. Managerial psychology I view more prominent than other psychology texts, and as I managed my life to spend time writing this, I hope you manage your time to enjoy the effort in each poem of this book to creatively express a good gusty imagination to flow with the words." />
