  <title>Black Rose - Kennard Gregg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Girls
Girls to me, are like honey to a bee.
Sweet, natural, and pretty to see.
Theyre like water, with its strange dimensions with a body that when it moves,
demands your attention.
So dont be shy.
Or turn your head astray.
Because its the better part of you. So dont give it away.
And the next time you approach her.
Be sure to let her know
Just how much you love her
And will never let her go.
So be firm with your judgment.
And sturdy with your stand.
For the many times you tell her.
She may not understand. So lady if your listening.
Dont make no snap decisions.
And even if you turn me down.
Its just my life I am living.
R
espect
Life equals love, and without respect
There is no love And love is
The giving of oneself
In the ultimate game of foreplay
And being able to accept this experience as true knowledge
And love is accepting responsibility
Hold heartedly, without question or doubt
And the answer to our greatest question is if ifs and ans were pots and pans
The world would be a kitchen
I
didnt
I did not come into your home to disturb the peace of your surroundings
and if theres one so bold
and unaware that he is alone
Well... he should have tore up his invite, and stayed his ass at home
You see the invitation was for those with means
A gentleman quite courteous to the extreme
With words that are clever quite witty with charm
Which pose no threat or need to be alarmed
I
am looking
I am looking for a woman
A woman with a sense of humor
A woman with common sense
A woman I can depend on when I havent gotten the rent
A woman I can believe in
A woman I can trust
A woman that says baby aint nothing too great for us
A woman thats in my corner
A woman that know I care
A woman thats always patient and aint getting in my hair
A woman thats healthy
A woman thats strong
A woman that know when I am leaving
I wont be gone for long
Freedom
I want to be free. Free to do as I please.
But nobodys saying youre going to live at ease.
You see free is one thing and dome is another.
Free-dom. Free-dom. Freedom.
Really being free is when you leave this place.
You see you left all the problems of having to contend
With people from another race, another place, another time.
Trying to put their way of thinking on your mind.
Never no lovin.
Just wanting to be okay.
Freedom should let these people know
That even a dog has a day
And as for me
I just want to be free
I wish I didnt have to work another day
For this money thats so badly needed.
But bills come and take it all away.
And as for me I want to be free
I am tired of making people laugh, sing, run around
Looking at me like a some kind of a clown
I just want to be free
So tell me
What does it mean to be free
And in turn, to see is to be
And what does it mean
To be, to be and not to be free
T
he Lord dont let you cry
Its hard for me to find the word
I want to say to you
Im sorry that I left you
But now I know the love we shared was true
It hurts for me to realize
That I carried on that way
And if I could Id say Im sorry
Each and every day
Youve inspired me pretty much
To be what I am today, and now I know with love like that
You just dont give it away
Why couldnt I realize
What it was I had
You see trying to live
Without true love
Can drive a person mad
But Im glad
Not mad at what I had
But the way things fell apart
Makes me feel so sad
Im glad to have met a person where as most men never find
You may think me stupid
But I always knew that you were mine
I hope lifes being good to you
What else can I say
Youve left an impression in my heart
Until this very day
So lets leave it as is
I dont want to die
How was I suppose to know
With love
The Lord dont let you cry
T
he American Dream
I want to be free
As free as an eagle
flying high above the hills
or as free as a buffalo grazing in the fields
as free as a rabbit hopping through the grass" />
