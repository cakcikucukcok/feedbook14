  <title>When God Is a Traveller - Arundhathi Subramaniam</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Shortlisted for the 2014 T.S. Eliot Prize Poetry Book Society Choice These are poems of wonder and precarious elation, about learning to embrace the seemingly disparate landscapes of hermitage and court, the seemingly diverse addresses of mystery and clarity, disruption and stillness - all the roadblocks and rewards on the long dangerous route to recovering what it is to be alive and human. Wandering, digging, falling, coming to terms with unsettlement and uncertainty, finiteness and fallibility, exploring intersections between the sacred and the sensual, searching for ways to step in and out of stories, cycles and frames - these are some of the recurrent themes. These poems explore various ambivalences - around human intimacy with its bottlenecks and surprises, life in a Third World megapolis, myth, the politics of culture and gender, and the persistent trope of the existential journey. Arundhathi Subramaniam&#39;s previous book from Bloodaxe, Where I Live: Selected Poems (2009), drew on her first two books published in India plus a whole new collection. When God is a Traveller is her fourth collection of poetry. &#39;A marvellous collection, wonderfully varied and rich... A remarkable book from a remarkable poet&#39; – John Burnside. &#39;This is writing that creeps up on the reader quietly, sometimes with just the whisper of a sari, or the taste of a lullaby, and yet spins suddenly on the edge of stark recognition&#39; – Imtiaz Dharker. &#39;...one of the finest poets writing in India today... It is not dulcet music you hear in Where I Live. It&#39;s the swish of swordplay, each poem skewered at sabre-point and then placed on an electric grille to sizzle like a rasher on a barbecue&#39; - Keki Daruwalla, The Hindu. &#39;...a strong personality and an individual voice; her poems feel as if they are meant to be read aloud as well as on the page.... Subramaniam is becoming a major poet.&#39; - Bruce King, Journal of Postcolonial Literature.&lt;/div&gt;" />
