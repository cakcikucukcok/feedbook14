  <title>For Those Who Seek to Know - Will &#39;Is Stevens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An Ode To The People
A crushing defeat to humanity
A hidden victory to insanity
Where patriots are sure to die
Where tyrants believe they can fly
The full truth remains unseen
By those whose thoughts are unclean
The lead us as lambs to the slaughter
Having forgot the word of our father
All life they willingly barter
They maul falling dollar
Deceive yourself no more with their lies
For we all must stand now with one cry
Or our land will surely die
The time for justice is at hand
No longer can we withstand
The shackles placed on us by man
While they rob you and me
What we have by our own decree
Our liberty and right to be free	
I tell you now of this theft
Before it leads us all to our deaths
So please do not be mistaken
The time is now to awaken
The future is ours for the taking
United together we are unequaled 
Let us decided as a people
For we all are unique yet equal
I Speak In A Tongue
I speak in a tongue
Unfamiliar to some
My words have no meaning
Amongst those who are dreaming
My words hold no anger
Only to a stranger
My words hold nourishment
All those in punishment
My words come clean
Those of you who have seen
They are right before your eye
Do not sit and let them go bye
Liberty Is
Freedom of liberty
A curse for purity
Unbridled free will
Surely will kill
Where is the fence
That rein&#39;s arrogance
Over ran by zealousness
Evil and greed
Here is a lasso
Let justice fly
Here is a fence
Its righteousness, I cry
The Roaring Of A Lune
Again tonight he is on the prowl
This rather peculiar yet handsome night owl
Once something has become afoul
On his face appears his scowl
Illuminating the night of our sky
Every night it seems he drives by
A new day for him is to imply
His way of saying goodbye
Those Who Seek to Know
For those who seek to know
As one goes about ones day
Thru poems he seeks to show
Our thoughts manifest the way
Considering starting at high noon
The words one chooses to relay
Appearing to thee ever so soon
The words one has chosen to prey
As we all move thru each hour
The spirit will choose to employ
As we all move thru each power
The spirit will choose to deploy
Now And Forever
Now you began to understand
One of the masters plans
Willing stand forth
At once today henceforth
Never blindingly yet everlastingly
Doing so eternally 
From now until evermore
Oh, Lord Creator always
Remember praise
Eternity your will partake
Vainly work to remake 
Evermore will be your fate
Reaping what have you been of late?" />
