  <title>A Heart&#39;s Awakening &amp; Journey Home - Donna J. Mertz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Focusing on what happiness you have will help to put everything into perspective. &lt;p&gt;
Donna Mertz has been recording her observations, feelings, and life lessons in poetry since her creative writing teacher introduced her to the free verse style. At a very early age, Donnas father handed her a camera and she has since spent most of her free time capturing the beauty of Gods creations. Donna was one of the first women in her area to become a professional photographer specializing in black and white portraiture.   Capturing a feeling with the release of a camera shutter, or with a minimal number of words is a passion of hers. By combining the two art forms, she is able to translate her poems imagery with the feelings her photographs evoke. 
This collection of poetry, A Heart&#39;s Awakening &amp; Journey Home, is a personal journey of the challenges she faced to regain a balance of peace and happiness in her life after escaping an unhealthy marriage with three small children. Her poetry tells of the transition from finding peace to recognizing happiness. Donna hopes her readers, recognizing a familiar place, may also find hope for peace, happiness, and love in their own lives." />
