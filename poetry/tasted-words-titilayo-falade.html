  <title>Tasted Words - Titilayo Falade</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If words are nothing but just words, why do they have so much power? Words spoken spitefully create deep wounds, while gracious words encourage, build up, and heal hurts. Spoken words are unseen but powerful. By revealing that words are like pedestrians, Titilayo demonstrates how words walk in our lives. Why do words have so much impact? How are our lives shaped by the words we speak and receive?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In Tasted Words, Titilayo reflects on the power of words, which may be spoken, written, or captured in pictures that speak more than a thousand words. Tasted Words is a collection of short stories and poetry with reminders, messages of love, and encouragement. In Tasted Words, Titilayo uses cues that are helpful reminders to challenge you to stop and think about your words, thoughts, and actions. This inspiring collection will challenge you to live purposefully, consider wisely, and interact graciously. Tasted Words also comprises poems that have arisen as a result of Bible study, life musings, and social crises. Titilayo intends to use part of the proceeds from Tasted Words in works of charity to the support victims of social crises.&lt;/p&gt;" />
