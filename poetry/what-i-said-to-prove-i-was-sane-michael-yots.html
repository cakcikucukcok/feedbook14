  <title>What I Said to Prove I Was Sane - Michael Yots</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As the title of this poetry collection playfully suggests, each poem in WHAT I SAID TO PROVE I WAS SANE represents an attempt by author Michael Yots to explain himself. Many of the poems also evoke a dream atmosphere that suggests that waking life and dream life are equally valid expressions of what we call reality. Most of all, his poems are explorations of the many selves that make up ones identity and make life such a fascinating journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; From In the Clock Shop to Teaching My Sons to Dance, Michael Yots captures both the essence of everyday life and the wisdom of age. He questions himself and what makes him tick in a thoroughly engaging manner that draws you into his world instead of leaving you to linger as a silent observer. WHAT I SAID TO PROVE I WAS SANE is a poetry collection that truly reveals the man and his emotional life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt; On the Birth of My First Child&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Through plate glass windows,&lt;br&gt;
I reach out to touch you,&lt;br&gt;
wrinkled beauty,&lt;br&gt;
crying unheard,&lt;br&gt;
 florescent glare,&lt;br&gt;
the cold of disconnection&lt;br&gt;
I reach out, impotent,&lt;br&gt;
heart in quarantine,&lt;br&gt;
to give a sign of love&lt;br&gt;
unable to compete with&lt;br&gt;
warmth of mother-milk.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
