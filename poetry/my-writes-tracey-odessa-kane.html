  <title>My Writes - Tracey Odessa Kane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;My Writes is sure to broaden the minds of readers. Tracey Odessa Kane has a natural gift for opening the eyes of her audience, allowing them to clearly see the injustices of the world as well as its beauty. Her balanced and thought&amp;ndash;provoking collection of poetry will inspire readers and set them on their own course to happiness, forgiveness and peace. Kane perceptively handles hard-hitting topics such as child abuse, religion, war, rape and discrimination, weaving her words to skilfully switch between themes and poems. Her words are sure to mesmerise readers and could possibly be seen as a much-needed wake up call to the masses. Tracey Odessa Kane&amp;rsquo;s lifelong passion, writing, emerged during her childhood. The youngest child in a forbidding family situation, writing became her most trusted ally, her saviour; it gave her solace and allowed her to think and to say all of those things that her everyday life wouldn&amp;rsquo;t allow her to voice. Her experience of being a young mother had a profound influence on her and her writing. Having always dreamt of writing books that could help people like her who had been forced to suffer imposed silence, she seized the motivation she&amp;rsquo;d gained from having a son. Above all, she wants people to know they were not alone, that they were loved, valued, had worth and purpose, in spite of the hand life may have initially dealt them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
