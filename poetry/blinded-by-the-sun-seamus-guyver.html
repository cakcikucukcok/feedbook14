  <title>Blinded by the Sun - Seamus Guyver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A passage between the stars, the moon and the thoughts caught within all of us. The different emotions we hide sometimes when left staring at the sun feeling the moon within your mind. For all the people and chances that have gone before. Of all the times we felt so much alive and the regrets we hold like the dark side of the moon. Knowing the journey will lead us within the sun; changing our views. Feeling a step within life is just a change within our minds. Now feel the journey within one mind; take the time to ponder all the thoughts and feelings felt within one sun and the mood of this life and how it can lift you higher and take you down when you lose the focus of the road that lies ahead and people who move like ghosts within your trail. Knowing one day you will unite the Sun and the Moon and find a distant peace within your heart. This may take time and Journey will have many falls. But the road is just a reflection within the memories of our minds." />
