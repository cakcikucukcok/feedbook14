  <title>The N.E.T. - Tshlaine Webster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book reveals in great detail, through a copulation of poetic writings, the intimate thoughts, desires, struggles, and victories of an African Princess. After looking in the mirror with no recollection of the face before her, Tsilahnees brokenness leads her back to the cross where she becomes Naked, Exposed and Transparent. 
 As she sojourns with her Father, God, she is confronted by the painful realities and the magnitude of lost/failed relationships, abandonment, lies, betrayal,  unforgiveness, immobilizing pain, lust, loneliness, lesbianism, illusions, delusions, and pride, that for years, unbeknownst to her and others, has kept her in a state of denial and spellbound fear. Tsilahnee begins to recognize that the Footprints left on her life has impacted her thought process greatly and even a Pinhole of unforgiveness will eventually lead to a gaping hole. 
In her quest for acceptance, complete wholeness, and reciprocity of love, Tsilahnees confessions, conversations, and dialogues with the Father, challenges the very essence of who she is, who she thought she was, and the control she thought she had. As she allows, the Father, so gently and eloquently with great patience, begins to captivate, motivate, and elevate her to dimensions unknown. So as she continues to write her way through this maze, exhortations, and revelations unfold, boundaries develop and the plagues that crippled her began to dissipate. The African Princess begins to understand that she is here by Divine Design, that she can possess an I Choose mentality and that she is destined to reign with Kings and Queens. Because Tsilahnees Hope Is In Prayer she Continues to move forward to become the Spiritual Assassin she was created to be.
