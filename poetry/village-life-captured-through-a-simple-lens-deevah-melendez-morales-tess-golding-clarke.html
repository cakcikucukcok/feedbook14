  <title>VILLAGE : Life Captured Through A Simple Lens - Deevah Melendez - Morales, Tess Golding-Clarke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As a photographer I have chosen to use the power of imagery, not only to show the energy and colour that is so typical of Village life in Africa &amp;nbsp;but to also capture the essence of how human values manifest themselves and what they can teach us.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the Village I learned that where there is effort there is dignity and purpose.&amp;nbsp; I saw that no matter how little people had, they took care of what they did have and shared with those who had less.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In the Village, what is lacking in economic wealth is made up in resiliency, ingenuity, wisdom and faith.&amp;nbsp; It is there that I truly witnessed that thinking&amp;nbsp;and working collectively for the common good really works.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I hope that the words and the photographs in this book successfully relay the message that even in the face of adversity people do live productive, creative and spiritual lives that are driven by a strong sense of dignity, identity and community ownership.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Photographed in Kenya, Lamu, &amp;nbsp;Ethiopia, Rwanda and Zanzibar.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Proceeds from the sale of this book will help bring solar power to Mama Ann&amp;#39;s Health Centre in western Kenya.
