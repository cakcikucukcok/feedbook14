  <title>Poems by Nikki - Nikia Latoya Lightbourne Amann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nikia L. Lightbourne Amann  was born in Miami,Florida on April 24, 1976. As a child  Nikia was determined and stubborn. When she started school she enjoyed subjects like English and History. Nikia started writing poems in high school because she was bored. She wrote poems about her life and experiences as a teenager and an only child. Nikia was alone most of the time and on her own. She
worked hard at finding her own  place in history. Her poems provided her with the outlet she needed to express herself and relay her feelings out loud. For her it was better to write her thoughts and feelings down on paper rather than exercise her will upon others. So she wrote.
In 1999, Nikia joined the military and has found a home in helping people and protecting her country and its freedoms. She is a mother of a 12-year-old daughter named Destiny who she talks about in one of her poems. She also has a three-year-old son named Bernard Jr." />
