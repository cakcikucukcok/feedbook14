  <title>A Prelude of Disclosure - Astroglo DeCerveau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="These poems were taken from a voluminous stock of writings that I have written through the years; many of the poems were composed recently and in the decade succeeding the millennium. Yet, many others were in French in my teenage years and early adulthood. That is, the memories of the past have helped me to reconstruct and translate a small bunch of those poesies into English. Although my mind, sometimes, gave partial texts, I was able to fill in the blanks in English aided by the remembrance of time, places and events.
However, all the verses - those I have translated and those I wrote in English  are based on my social, political and philosophical views, factual events, experiences and societies surrounding my life at any given time  both in USA and overseas. So, I have chosen this particular cluster of poems for this book because, I believe, the texts are more suitable for a first introduction or a first disclosure to the public." />
