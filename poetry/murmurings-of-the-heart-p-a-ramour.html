  <title>Murmurings of the Heart - P. A. Ramour</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This collection of poetry was inspired by poet P. A. Ramours Angel of Love, and it is with her in mind that he expresses his innermost thoughts and feelings of love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poems in &lt;i&gt;Murmurings of the Heart: One Angelic Kiss&lt;/i&gt; were inspired in the years after the poet P. A. Ramour discovered the relaxation and enjoyment of simply expressing his thoughts and feelings in verse. With no purpose or goal in mind beyond than the introspection, he writes of his early family life with humor and divulges some of his meanderings in nostalgia.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Ramours life changed considerably with the passing of his wife and a failed second marriage; in response to these changes, his poetry became a release for his overflowing emotions. The newfound freedom to follow his love of music ultimately led to the meeting of his Angel of Love. Suddenly his need to write about his new love accelerated to an intense desire to pour out his heart in these poems. They became good friends, and before long her beauty and talent inspired Ramour to write of his love for her.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Overwhelmed by her love of life, he opens his heart to her through &lt;i&gt;Murmurings of the Heart&lt;/i&gt;. His verses reveal the true love and beauty of a relationship seemingly arranged in heaven for their golden years.&lt;/p&gt;" />
