      <meta name="description" content="Your book is amazing, Richard! Ha, Ha, Ha. I think you are a very talented, truly funny psychic....as we all know; NOTHING is more healing and spiritual than humor!  Don&#39;t stop, brother! &lt;br&gt;- xoJ&lt;br&gt;

&quot;I&#39;ve no doubt there are angels among us. And Richard Spasoff is one of them. Thank you, Richard, for reminding us that God, and the Angels, have a great sense of humor.&quot; &lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Yoo HOOO.. Richy,,,, &#39;With his own brand of humor &amp; wit, Richard Spasoff makes an interesting and entertaining read, as well as enlightening us, on a fascinating subject nice stuff, I do believe there are angels and energies that can help us through life, and help us towards our goals and successes, we have to take time to be aware of thier presence, and allow our selves to recieve the messages and learn through the lessons of our experiences.. It&#39;s hard being human sometimes, but there is a greater, powerful, force and &#39;light&quot; and that we must embrace and trust, and BE. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Mr. Spasoff book does a great job of raising the awareness of the spiritual connections between us all. Angels, God, Jesus, they&#39;re all there when you think things are hopeless. When they diagnosed me with &#39;terminal cancer&#39; and gave me 6-12 months to live, it is nothing short of miraculous that I am still alive ten years later. Thank you Richard for bringing hope to a desperate world&quot; &lt;br&gt;

Richard Spasoff is a cracker jack story teller If you have been living in darkness, then you need to read this book. It will put a smile on your face as it pulls you into the light and shows you the way. Great work, Richard, it made me want to fly!&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Through his storytelling and quotes, Richard Spasoff is at once humorous, intimate, serious, enlightening, and spiritual.  There is no doubt that angels live among us.  Richard teaches us to be aware of the power of miracles and be open to it.  As Richard mentions, life can be very difficult, but there are always angels among us who help us along the way.  We must be open to seeing the positive, beautiful messages that God and the angels send us throughout our lives.  Even in the most difficult and challenging times of our lives, miracles are happening and angels are protecting us. Thank you, Richard, for your insight, your wisdom and your entertaining book.  Everyone should take the time to read it, for we all need to remember that indeed angels do exist and there is a reason for everything that happens to us in our lifetimes&lt;br&gt;

I was at an impasse in my life when I received an email from Richard asking me to read his book. I was delighted and honored that he would ask me to share my thoughts
Richard insightful spiritual writings help me to relax and let God take charge of my life. He helped me to understand that angels are also looking over me and my son, protecting us from lifes misgivings.&lt;br&gt;
He made me realize that I needed to bring myself back down to earth, to put my faith in the power of prayer, visualization and to release myself of the anger and fear that has been holding me back. Thank you Richard, I love you,

Richard, I just read your book. Wow! It&#39;s so interesting. I&#39;ve laughing, crying and enjoy it do much. You had an special gift. The book came in the right moment for me, sometimes we just felt like if we&#39;re losing our minds and then you came in and offer me to read your book, and now I return to my comfort zone with a fulfillment sense that I belong and that everything it&#39;s just going to be fine.
Thanks a lot dear, for just being you!!!!!!
