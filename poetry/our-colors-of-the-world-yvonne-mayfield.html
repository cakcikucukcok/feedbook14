      <meta name="description" content="Writing is enjoyable. Its become a big part of my life.
Its one of my passions, my creative side. I love it so much. I cant put the pen down at all at times. Ive been writing story after story. My creative side is showing.
These stories are stories that I enjoy writing.
Now writing is in my life. I think Im going to keep it. It keeps me happy, inspiring me to write more and more each time and every day. I remember my first poem. I wrote where I was in high school. Then finding out how much more and more I can write gave me such a healthy well-being. Actually, writing made my life better. My self-esteem has risen now. I want to keep my writing and make stories come alive for the future to encourage others to use their wisdom and write." />
