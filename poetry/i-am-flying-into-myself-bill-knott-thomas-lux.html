  <title>I Am Flying into Myself - Bill Knott, Thomas Lux</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A selection of Bill Knott&#39;s life work--testimony of his enduring, &quot;thorny genius&quot; (Robert Pinsky)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Going to sleep, I cross my hands on my chest.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;They will place my hands like this.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;It will look as though I am flying into myself.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For half a century, Bill Knott&#39;s brilliant, vaudevillian verse electrified the poetic form. Over his long career, he studiously avoided joining any one school of poetry, preferring instead to freewheel from French surrealism to the avant-garde and back again--experimenting relentlessly and refusing to embrace straightforward dialectics. Whether drawing from musings on romantic love or propaganda from the Vietnam War, Knott&#39;s quintessential poems are alive with sensory activity, abiding by the pulse and impulse of a pure, restless emotion. This provocative, playful sensibility has ensured that his poems have a rare and unmistakable immediacy, effortlessly crystalizing thought in all its moods and tenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An essential contribution to American letters, &lt;i&gt;I am Flying into Myself&lt;/i&gt; gathers a selection of Knott&#39;s previous volumes of poetry, published between 1960 and 2004, as well as verse circulated online from 2005 until a few days before his death in 2014. His work--ranging from surrealistic wordplay to the anti-poem, sonnets, sestinas, and haikus--all convenes in this inventive and brilliant book, arranged by his friend the poet Thomas Lux, to showcase our American Rimbaud, one of the true poetic innovators of the last century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I Am Flying into Myself: Selected Poems, 1960-2014&lt;/i&gt; celebrates one of poetry&#39;s most determined outsiders, a vitally important American poet richly deserving of a wider audience.&lt;/p&gt;" />
