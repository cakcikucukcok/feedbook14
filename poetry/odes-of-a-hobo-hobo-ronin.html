  <title>Odes of a Hobo - Hobo Ronin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I&#39;ve always suffered from dyslexia but although I have mentioned this fact to my family and close friends; my quick wit, confidence and my generally eloquent manner of conversation has always hidden just how seriously the condition has affected parts of my life. 
This struggle has given me a unique perspective on the world and helped me to look at situations and people not just through words, which I&#39;ve always struggled to do, but through the actions of Belief, perception and circumstance of an individual
With these works I have tried to use words in a simplistic fashion to engage people of all abilities and hopefully to notice, see and establish the truth of which I write. 
I am of a philosophical view with a pragmatic, optimistic outlook in regards to the world&#39;s problems and strife&#39;s. I think my ultimate goal is to draw attention to society&#39;s understanding of perception. 
Enjoy my writing and endeavour to make sense of what I&#39;m trying to express." />
