  <title>Fourth Dimension - Marcus “Thareal Kidd” Cureton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Growing up on the south side of Chicago, Marcus Thareal Kidd Cureton chose the wrong crowds to hang with. Selling drugs to keep up with the in-crowd, he knew that it wouldnt last long; but he continued to live that type of lifestyle because it was normal where he came from. When he was only nine, Marcus found his gift and passion for writing and making his own comic books to entertain his friends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also embraced poetry as a way to express himself freely. At the age of eighteen, after dropping out of high school, he went to prison for attempted murder and first-degree murder for his part in a drug deal gone bad. Feeling the pain and remorse as they began to take a toll on him, Marcus found his gift once again. His writing provided a way for him to escape the reality of his situation. He wrote of his heartaches and pains; his ups and downs; and his desire to get back into the outside world to help build stronger youth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fourth Dimension&lt;/i&gt; is a poetic explosion of heartfelt emotions as the tears of reality strike. You can feel the authors emotion in each and every word of his poetry.&lt;/p&gt;" />
