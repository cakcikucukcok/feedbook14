  <title>Morning Poems - Robert Bly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;Morning Poems&lt;/em&gt; is a sensational collection &amp;#8212; Robert Bly&#39;s best in many years.  Inspired by the example of William Stafford, Bly decided to embark on the project of writing a daily poem: Every morning he would stay in bed until he had completed the day&#39;s work.  These &#39;little adventures/In Morning longing,&#39; as he calls them, address classic poetic subjects (childhood, the seasons, death and heaven) in a way that capitalizes fully on the pun in the book&#39;s title.  These are morning poems, full of the delight and mystery of waking in a new day, and they also do their share of mourning, elegizing the deceases and capturing the &#39;moment of sorror before creation.&#39;  Some of the poems are dialogues where unconventional speakers include mice, maple trees, bundles of grain, the body, the &#39;oldest mind&#39; and the soul.  A particularly moving sequence involves Bly&#39;s imaginative transactions with a great and unlikely precursor, Wallace Stevens.  The whole is a fascinating and original book from one of our most fascinating authors.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;#8212; David Lehman &lt;/blockquote&gt;" />
