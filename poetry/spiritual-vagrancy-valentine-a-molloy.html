  <title>Spiritual Vagrancy - Valentine A. Molloy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This little book arrived in its present form almost by accident. Over the years, Ive scribbled bits of poems here and there, and while trying to impress a lady, I put about twenty poems together and was astonished when she returned those poems in a startling waterfall of words. This presentation startled me, to see my words displayed in such a chaotic yet evocative manner. She was the first deep voice of encouragement. Sometime later, while in Glastonbury, I found myself inspired to write more poetry, eventually realizing my collection had expanded to a body of work that could be presented in book form. 
The initial name for this book was Snapshots, which describes my poetry perfectly. Firstly, quick insights into whatever is playing out in the moment  waking up in the morning to a dream continuing. Secondly, reflecting back emotionally the unfinished episodes of yesteryear  a previous landlady wiping out two months rent so I could start afresh. Thirdly, joyful ranting on my soapbox, verbally challenging another view. 
Then there is a prayerful side to it, which I find essential and which is nice to share. Some of these are part of my continuous practice. 
 My present life cultivation is holding with others the energy of the five-acre field You will find the five-acre field on the ground where you walk!" />
