  <title>Unseen Wonders - J. K. Hutchison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My intention for this book is to take the reader with me on a journey to see the beauty surrounding us that we never take the time to see. If I can take your mind off your troubles for an hour or two and maybe even make you chuckle, then the book and I have both served our purpose. The best times of my life have been spent standing on a mountaintop, marveling at a field of wildflowers, or sitting by a stream while listening to the bugle of a bull elk.
I have been blessed to live in one of the most beautiful places I have ever knownColorado.
As a photographer in Colorado, I have the opportunity to take my best picture ever around every corner.
I cant help but look at this picture and wonder where my journey will lead me. Whats on the other side of that hill? All I know when I start out is that theres a wonderful story around every turn that I cant wait to experience. I love to let my imagination run wild and go wherever it will. Please come with me now on a journey into my world.
The Miracles of Nature." />
