  <title>Sombrero Monologue - Murphy Biriabebe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="SOMBRERO MONOLOGUE was an attempt at encouragement in a time of dire distress. It was an intendment for the despondent spirit that strength and purpose could still be found in a time of bleak hopes. The first series of poems were written within three days of a dilemma. They are poems of hope, faith, trust and realization written to heal the broken heart. But it wasnt until after a year that I was able to write the other poems of triumph, freedom, survival and love. These are qualities soul needs to reach its goals. One may find within it, other matters, since in an effort to merely encourage, the muse in the poet took flight and re-plotted the direction of this work. During the initial writings, I devised a serialized pattern for writing this work with a rhythmic song like metre which contributed immensely to the expedite completion of this work. 
The primal inspiration being the encouragement received from Kathy Black of the Vermont Studio Centre, U.S.A, after the events of September 11 2001 spoilt my chances of a residency in the U.S. but through the encouragement of this woman I never met, a fire started in my heart. That fire became the torch for an immortal goal, lighting the gloom passages of despondency and failure that followed, revealing a series of poetry to me in a manner I had never experienced before. These poems became SOMBRERO MONOLOGUE. The message has gone beyond that and reached Universal dimensions and my approach has been metaphysical. 
Here, it appears as twelve songs divided into two books sang in twelve days by Diowei, son of Kiemoye, keeper of the sacred flame of Diseye and the sentry of Kemeikiyou, during his sojourn to the banks of the Sombrero River to purge himself of the karma of life, where he paused long enough to compile these poems. 
Each song has twelve verses with equal number of words and equal number of lines as well, with the end verse leading to the beginning verse. 
I hereby present to the reading world; SOMBRERO MONOLOGUE, hoping it will serve as a useful addition to literary shelves the world over." />
