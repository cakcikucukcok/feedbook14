  <title>Poems for Conservatives - Pat Morrell-Donnelly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Pats book Poems For Conservatives contains poems mostly in the political vein, most written the last couple of years as radicalism in Washington D. C. has shown its face in such a devastating manner. This type of Government is not what the people of America are about or what they stand for--the vote buying, back room deals, and lack of transparency. Pat&#39;s poems reveal her belief that this great country is being taken down a dangerous path, and needs to be stopped. Its her opinion that if those presently in charge can get rid of the seniors through a Government run health care system that withholds valuable drugs and care and sends them to an early grave, they would have an open field to indoctrinate our youth who then would never know the great country previous generations have been privileged to know. Born into &quot;humble beginnings&quot; Pat has &quot;always been proud of her country, unlike Michele Obama who stated a number of times for the first time in her adult life she was proud of her country.  The older generation is well aware of the price of freedom. They know about free enterprise, entrepreneurship, and dreaming big dreams. They know about failing. They know about determination. These things have made America great. Not the re-distribution of wealth, or big Government. Beliefs must be passed on about unlimited opportunities this country affords for those willing to work hard, pay their dues, and take advantage of the possibilities. Just get the Government out of the way. Pat feels we must pass on our   Constitution, and values and pride in this country. We must pass on the America we have known. We can not allow any group to take away the rights our forefathers fought and died for and left in our care." />
