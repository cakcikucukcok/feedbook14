  <title>Heart Strings - Jan Bryan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hi my name is Jan Bryan.
I am a wife and mother of 2 children, one girl and one boy, and the Grandmother of one girl.
My poem All Grown Up was the first to be published by The Poetry Guild.   I was published and received The Editors Choice Award from the National Poetry Library and also The International Poetry Library.  I have also been published by my hometown news paper The Shawnee News and Star and the Delaware County Daily Times. 
There have been some interesting times in my life, some sad, some happy and others just plain crazy.  Each one has left an impression on my life in some manner and that reflects in my poetry. 
Please read and enjoy my poetry. Maybe it will inspire you to write some of you own and pass it along to your loved ones.
There is no better gift than one from the heart that is created by the Heartstrings of your life." />
