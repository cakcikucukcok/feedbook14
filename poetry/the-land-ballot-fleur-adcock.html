  <title>The Land Ballot - Fleur Adcock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;?A land ballot was the means by which Fleur Adcock&#39;s grandparents, immigrants from Manchester during World War I, were able to bid for a piece of native bush on the slopes of Mount Pirongia in the North Island of New Zealand. Their task was to turn this unpromising acreage into a dairy farm. When things didn&#39;t work out as they had hoped much of the responsibility for running the farm and engineering their eventual escape fell on their teenage son, Adcock&#39;s father. This sequence of poems follows the course of their efforts and builds up a portrait of a small, isolated community. &#39;In a compelling mix of fact, conjecture and imagination, she recreates one of the most fascinating and strange periods of our colonial history: small isolated communities establishing determined pockets of Europeanness in an alien environment&#39; – Sarah Quigley, New Zealand?Listener. &#39;Informality and immediacy are vivid ways to remake a world; and Adcock&#39;s style has not dated in the half-century since her debut&#39; – Fiona Sampson, Guardian. &#39;Fleur Adcock is as clear-eyed as always in a collection that ranges widely over lost worlds, family histories ...but always maintains the art of seemingly artless observation&#39; – Adam Newey, Guardian.&lt;/div&gt;" />
