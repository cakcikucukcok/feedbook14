  <title>Wordwaves - Elsa Colligan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this collection, Colligan creatively pairs haiku and poems, strengthening the value, relationships, and sensibilities of both. Her formatting of the title after the poem creatively reinforces the haiku sense of the book while each leading haiku expertly sets the scene and tone for the next poem. The structure quickly captures you with wonder at what comes next. Make no mistake, this is a poetry book, but adeptly assembled to explore, mine, and extend the links between Western and Eastern forms. With her years of writing experience, Colligans use of imagery and expert word-smithing makes this connection enjoyable, memorable, and enriching. Her mature and finely developed poetic and haiku skills carry you far from the everyday, providing the perspective and nuance at the very heart of our existence.
Francis Masat, author of &lt;i&gt;Threshing&lt;/i&gt;
Full of lyrical verse with fresh, strong imagery, &lt;i&gt;Wordwaves&lt;/i&gt; shines a concentrated spotlight on the world around us; it explores the magic of nature, art, and life itself.
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;would-be samurai-
                       intense games
                                         of haiku &amp; football
I have trained a long time
for the Olympics of self
but still the gold eludes me.
I tell myself
that it is not about the winning
&amp; almost believe it.
After a lifetime
of questionable choices,
one night, I wake up
&amp; remember everything.
Finally I have something to say.
It is tearing me apart.
The party is over.
Carnival has begun.
THE GAMES&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;" />
