  <title>Poems for Everyday People - Ilena J. Crushshon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my little book of &lt;em&gt;Poems for Everyday People&lt;/em&gt;. Before you read its contents, I have a confession to make; I am not a poet! That&amp;#39;s right. I&amp;#39;m a writer but I&amp;#39;m not a poet. How can that be, you may ask? It&amp;#39;s simple. For one year God has awakened me at 3:15AM to give me a new poem, twenty-five in all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, I tried to ignore the pithy little nuggets but it soon became clear these were not just poems. They were words of love, encouragement, peace, joy and inspiration spoken by God through me. They are a gift to his children, everyday people facing life&amp;#39;s trials and tribulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you, God, for choosing me as your voice.&lt;/p&gt;" />
