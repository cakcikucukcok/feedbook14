  <title>Spiritual Revelations - Lynn Lee Bryant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Spiritual Revelations&lt;/i&gt;, Lynns 3rd book continues to demonstrate her remarkable and powerful poetic ability to captivate readers. The authors poetry, song and short story provides a nearly visual glimpse into her thought as she humbly expresses words of honor and worship to the Lord and God. You feel a poignant correlation with the author, as she delivers messages of adoration, hope, praise, mourning the loss of family members, child abuse, romance and triumph. You understand the authors true and calming sense of peace. A must have for lovers our God and Savior; of poetry, song, and short story.&lt;/p&gt;
Peeling Myself a Soul, 2004, was the debut of a powerful new force in African American Poetry. The book (hardback) collection of 50 poetry, song and short story infused with an overwhelming sense of love and personal growth, as though on a pilgrimage to discover ones self. Weighty issues such as abuse, race relations and relationships are explored. Filled with emotional resonance, this reading remains inherently accessible to all.&lt;/p&gt;
Animalyrics, the authors 2nd book, 2011, pays homage to animals, and all of creation. The book is an exceptional
compilation of 40 poetry, song, and short story streaming with adoration for all life within the universe. The earth and mother-nature are also explored, as well as mankinds disrespect for the planet, and child abuse. An animal lover myself, you will find these readings reflective of today, while relaxing to words which will inspire and motivate you." />
