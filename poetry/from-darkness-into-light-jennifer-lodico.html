  <title>From Darkness into Light - Jennifer Lodico</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Truth is never a popular concept in any society where mankind lives.  Truth is ridiculed and rejected and the bearers of it are often persecuted, even martyred for it.  But truth forever stands in the face of all its adversaries.  And truth can never and will never be vanquished.  For truth has always existed and truth will never end.  For, Jesus Christ is the Truth, the Way, and the Life.   No man cometh to the Father, but by Him.  The poems in this book were inspired by God and are intended to bring glory to His Son, Jesus Christ, while exposing the stark reality of sin and the ravaging effects it is having on mankind.  Some of the poems are based on the authors life experiences, while others were created by trying to envision life through the eyes of others.   He Set My Spirit Free is the testimony of the authors life changing encounter with Jesus Christ.  Mother, I Will Meet You, was written in memory of the authors mother, Winifred Nostrand, who recently passed away in November 2008 at the age of 71.  Also, Daddy, My Heart is Broken, was made in sad memory of her father, who passed away in June 1996.  The Noble Husband, is dedicated to the authors dear husband, James Lodico.  It is the authors heartfelt prayer, that the poems in this book will not only move the hearts of Christian men and women into a closer relationship with Jesus Christ, but that it would convict the unsaved man of his sins so that he would turn to Jesus Christ, the only One who can save him and provide an entrance into  heaven.  Any direct quotes from the Bible were taken from the King James Version." />
