  <title>Somewhere to Go, Some Difference to Make - Mark D. Kimball</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Somewhere to Go, Some Difference to Make&lt;/i&gt; offers a collection of observations of one mans American journey presented in poetry and prose and told with humor, pathos, candor, and affection. Author Mark Kimball shares his insight on topics as wide-ranging as Secretariat and Billy the Kid, love and marriage, and the music of ABBA. His self-deprecating style is evident as he tackles such topics as college football, Thomas Jefferson, and many more, including a very special section on how to survive after graduation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;To Thomas Jefferson &lt;br&gt;
You were often wrong&lt;br&gt;
And just as often slow,&lt;br&gt;
But history must be fair, Tom,&lt;br&gt;
And I forgave you long ago.&lt;br&gt;
Some only hear the darker words&lt;br&gt;
And never let them go,&lt;br&gt;
But I have heard the music, Tom,&lt;br&gt;
And I forgave you long ago.&lt;br&gt;
I hope they find the notes &lt;br&gt;
And someday feel the flow,&lt;br&gt;
But you changed the world forever, Tom,&lt;br&gt;
And I forgave, and learned to love you,&lt;br&gt; Long ago.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
