  <title>My Poet Tree - Mike Carter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My Poet Tree reflects my personal journey through life expressed in verse 
From the consequences of war in Painted In Red to the emotional turmoil
 of lost love in Crippled Smiles. We cross a landscape where the
 frailty of age is captured in Of Our Lives.
Then we pause for a moment to consider the guilt or innocence in
 This Cell My Prison, before moving on to the fragile state of this planet in
 I Challenge The Day.
there are many twists and  emotions that are examined throughout the book
 an example being We Wear It Well.
Occasionally we stop to smile as in Theres An Elephant In My Garden.
 Before dipping in to memories of childhood as revisited in 
Theres A Secret In My Cupboard. 
Then we leave behind the absurdity of imagined horror in Reaper; 
 to slip into self-awareness in Made Of Stone. 
Along the way we will relive the  terror of an ocean storm in
 The Sinking Of The Santa Fe. Then move to a poem titled
 Thats My Life, an attempt to understand the things that motivate
 the way we are. Included is a tribute to a great poet in
 An Ode To Edgar Allan Poe. 
So I welcome you to join me,  and share the experiences and memories 
that is My Poet Tree" />
