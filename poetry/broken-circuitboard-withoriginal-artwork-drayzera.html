  <title>Broken Circuitboard withOriginal Artwork - DrayZera</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dray is a striking, powerful and engaging performer. His live readings are a wonderful mass of passion and kinetic energy; an experience not to be missed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book finally gives Dray&amp;rsquo;s words the opportunity to stand for themselves, stripped of the colourful trappings of performance. Now the reader can pore over and engage with Dray&amp;rsquo;s words on their own merit. At last, we have a publication of his works, enabling us to step inside the performer, see the soul that resides in him, expressed here through his poetry.Make no mistake, like all art, that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;rsquo;re holding in your hands; a piece of Dray&amp;rsquo;s soul, extracted and refined into words. Some will bring delight; some of it may be uncomfortable to read; some will wash over you and some will sink into you, make you think and leave you changed. But it is all authentic, bold and dynamic; not for the faint hearted, the fragile or easily offended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dray doesn&amp;#39;t shy from exposing the ugly as well as the beautiful; shining a light on that which others keep hidden. So be warned, it can be a challenging read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t have to agree with Dray to explore and appreciate his honesty. You&amp;#39;re not being asked to align yourself with his positions. Dray and I, for example, are like chalk and cheese! But that should never stop us from engaging with and appreciating each other&amp;rsquo;s art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So take your time, dear reader, and experience Dray&amp;rsquo;s words for yourself. I know I&amp;#39;m going to!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keith Sadler, singer song-writer and performer(2017)&lt;/p&gt;" />
