From surrealistic dreamscapes to haunting bittersweet memories, through a restless melody, to an impossible reality, then a quiet awakening but are you really awake or are YOU the dream? R. Dean Moudys  inspired I, Witness is an appealing volume of a dream journey that will often call to you long after you attempt to put it down." />
