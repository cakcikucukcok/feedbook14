  <title>Breakthrough - Tanya Lynn Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Theres nothing quite as exhilarating as falling or being in love.  It can truly be a magical experience.  But, I know this euphoric energy called love that I write about in my new book entitled Breakthrough starts with me and how I feel about myself.  Accepting who I am and feeling unconditional love and compassion for myself, helped me to experience the same level of unconditional love and compassion for others.  With great effort and determination, love is the foundation for the most intimate, romantic relationships.  Like all else, relationships have a beginning and an end.  Some grow quickly, while others take longer to nurture.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Breakthrough is a compilation of my many unexpected challenges and triumphs of loves lovesickness, heartaches, and heartbreaks.  Im no expert in love by any means.  In Breakthrough you will come to know this first hand.  However, I do believe that when you meet that person that makes your heart flutter, the one person that satisfies your sexual and romantic desires, then that, to me, is love.  When you can show another person how you feel without speaking, I call that love.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In my lifetime, I have found amazing loves and I have lost some amazing loves.  I have had the kind of love that reminded me how simple it is to feel, a love that changed me, a love that left me hanging, and a love I never got over.  I can only live my life the way it was destined for me and I trust love to always be a part of my plan.  Love is exciting, whether it be puppy love or a unique platonic love, a lasting love or just a fling.  For some people love is based only on physical attraction and nothing more.   Others prefer a love that comes with commitment, trust, respect, and compromise.  For me, true love is simple and patient.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There are many things in life that will catch your eye, but only a few will catch your heartpursue those.
