  <title>A Thousand Worlds - John N. Heil</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The art of Haiku poetry, besides plain-spokenness, embodies a beauty and power that captivates hearts and minds everywhere. It is one of the enduring literary forms and for good reason.
Traditionally Haiku has emphasized a close relationship with the glories of nature. Most all appreciate a more intimate connection to that fascinating realm, in this case an expanded consciousness of nature&#39;s aliveness enhanced by the poetic perception.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The practice or technique of Haiku is readily understood, with stylistic characteristics quite elementary. There is much satisfaction derived from the creative process, appealing format
and dynamism of these verses. For readers and writers of Haiku it
is an uplifting engagement with the aesthetics of nature. When creatively involved, we also grow as persons in touch with the artistic longings of our human nature.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This book teaches how to relate to and carefully consider that natural world all around us. You will learn to communicate these observations and personal visions with sentiment and succinctly,as a poet would. Indeed, the volume is dedicated to all of us, the
poet of any kind in every heart. Its contents will thrill and enthrall
you with compelling insights to the method, striking examples of this sublime little art form.&lt;/P&gt;" />
