  <title>I Ain&#39;t Trying 2 Hear It. - Melvin White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The ending of a new beginning. This book needs no introduction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s sincerely from the heart of a God fearing man. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my tribute from God for blessing me with so much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was only right that I pray for a book of poems for the ones who are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;physically deaf as well as spiritually deaf. This book is very entertaining&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mind blowing displaying true brilliance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God gets all the praise because without Him I&#39;m nothing. I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. Corinthians 4(13). May you enjoy true artwork and journey into the minds of our spiritual realm an find out how you can overcome Satan and his evil demons. We all hear that evil whisper but it&#39;s up to us to tell Satan I rebuke you and I aint trying to hear it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For access to the poet THE WORD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please contact at 913-565-5525 for information concerning new books. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also go to www.MELVINLEEWHITETHEWORD.com if this is more reliable for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for spending your hard earned money on a person so thankful and humble to be apart of your reading world. Also be on the look out for the next book called Life After Prison. It&#39;s basically going to show you how the books I put out in the future lead up to my life after prison. All boks compliment one after another. I want my audience to grow with me over the years. Please spread the word. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truly Yours THE WORD &lt;/p&gt;" />
