  <title>Bit&#39;s ~N~ Peace&#39;s of Me &#39;&#39;Alberta&#39;&#39; - Alberta D. Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is an Autobiography in Poetry.  It is also a thank you for those who did not let me slip into a black whole of lifelessness during some of the most difficult challenges of my life.  Pain, physically, emotionally, spiritually, depression, devastation, death, life, rape, incenses, divorce, marriage, sunlight, darkness and much more.  The appreciation of God, my family, and my family of Angels, is so empowering, I was able to find some peace within many areas of my life where torment once lived. For this reason, had no other choice but to honor them in writing as God gave me rhythm to release the joy and pain of my life.  
You will notice my book does not open like an ordinary book. Our lives are far from ordinary. We can all say, better then some, worse than others. I want you to utilize my story to encourage you, to tell your story. To give Honor to God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ Our Lord and Savior. Your Earthly Angels and to Yourself. It is time to be honest and make peace with loved ones and yourself. Come out of your shell, be creative, share who you are. I pray that my story will awaken you to find your great purpose on your journey toward the gifts of a
prosperous successful life. That God has so richly prepared for us, not just in Heaven, but here on earth too." />
