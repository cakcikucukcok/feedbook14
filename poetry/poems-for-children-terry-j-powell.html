  <title>Poems for Children - Terry J Powell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A mix of experiences that you will feel, emotions to make you smile, cry, laugh, and sometimes, weep. Who knows where my poems may take you or what emotions you will feel. The Journey has just begun and will venture through the many unpublished poems yet to come. Some will make you think in thought-provoking ways, others will astound you with the twists. Other poems will make you relate to the experiences you may have had or felt in situations of your life. So the journey begins. 
This book I wrote for children of all ages from 9 to 99. I hope they are deemed suitable for those who read it. Obviously there has to be some parent guidance for those who are at a very young age. There&#39;s a whole range of different experiences that I guess most people will and can be able tolerate to, my sense of humor can sometimes get me into all sorts of trouble and I guess that&#39;s why I see the funny side of life. The way I see it is that life can throw an awful lot of trials and tribulations any given time, and lets face it I have had my share of them. Any way kids please enjoy what I have written, and parents if you feel any of the poems are unsuitable please don&#39;t read them to the children. The Poems are mainly for older children and teenagers, I hope they make you all understand and maybe smile. Many thanks Terry." />
