  <title>Bull Headed Saviour - Joseph Lamm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;A BOOK OF SOUL ENERGIES IN POEMS &amp; LYRICS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
That &lt;i&gt;Bull Headed Saviour&lt;/i&gt; exists, writes Joseph Lamm,  is a
testament to grace. When all is taken away, when we reach the
pouring out of our self, it is our redemption.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
After completing the poetic narrative &lt;i&gt;Andeans Ascent&lt;/i&gt;, Joseph Lamm
found critical acclaim and modest chart success in music with the
albums &lt;i&gt;Watching The Coming Storm&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Standing In The Tower&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
In 2003 he began work on a project that was born out of a passion for the writings of
William Blake. Lamm also had high esteem for beat poet, author, and playwright Michael McClures body of
work, especially his bold and daring collection &lt;i&gt;Rain Mirror&lt;/i&gt;. The result 
of an emotional and physiological collapse as McClure himself
described it, &lt;i&gt;Rain Mirror&lt;/i&gt; was a foreshadowing of Lamms own parallel
experience two years later, as a purging of his soul gave way to a
wondrous spiritual awakening. &lt;i&gt;Bull Headed Saviour&lt;/i&gt; entwines the beauty
of nature, the emotion and desires of the heart, and the spirit of the 
soul toward a common celebration found within everyone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This collection contains many of the poems and lyrics that were
written during this period, along with selected lyrics from the albums
&lt;i&gt;Watching The Coming Storm&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Standing In The Tower&lt;/i&gt;, and his newest work,
&lt;i&gt;Hot As Sun, Vol.1&lt;/i&gt;." />
