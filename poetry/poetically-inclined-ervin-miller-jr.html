  <title>Poetically Inclined - Ervin Miller Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book of poems was created to reach two sets of people: one being the spiritual people, and the other being the world. This started as a diary of sorts, as I captured the battle that wages daily between my flesh and spirit man. But along the way, diary transformed into something more. This process became the silent cries of the mute, the whisper of the wind, the issues of the streets, and the everyday components that make this journey enjoyable, daunting, intimidating, exhilarating, breathtaking, sad, and pulse altering. Without the Lords guidance, I wouldve given up after I made it to sixty-five poems only to have them deleted. Ive known that there must have been something special about this project as the enemy still felt the need to attack it. After, You spoke through my pastor, Kenneth Rouche, to give me the encouragement and prayer to move forward. Then came the incident that occurred with my book saved on a flash drive. It was never seen after it was left in my 2005 Chevy Malibu that was stolen. 
However, this journey has truly taught me that writing is still a source of freedom for me. Its the ultimate getaway, like a vacationing spot. Its here that Ive been able to release my true creative nature and limitless unlocked potential. Within writing, I find a bond and a suited outlet. This is my tool that helps me give back through my point of view. Moreover, this is the understanding in which I accept my divine God-given calling. This project is the testament of the resolve that God placed within me, along with that never-quit mentality and drive. The pieces featured in this book are primarily from the frame of 08-10. It was within this time frame that my life and view would change on primary issues, such as my spirit versus my flesh. This stage set the tone for this book only being two chapters, which shows a silent struggle taking shape. My biggest inspiration came directly from the mirror, as it showcased what could never be hidden. It was there that I was able to see into the gateway of my own soul. It showed my flaws, my success, my many masks, and the internal lies we try to tell ourselves. I felt my own monumental strides, and saw my rock bottom decline. At my lowest point, I finally understood the battle and how it wasnt one of flesh and blood, that it was true spiritual warfare. I learned to respect the truth and see this world through another set of eyes and from two viewpoints when needed. This journey truly became more than a project; it became a diary of sorts, as well as my main resort. It also became an awakening voyage that saw me survive turbulent uncharted territory and bring back with me the proof that Im Poetically Inclined and Raw and Uncut." />
