  <title>Body Language - Armani Murphy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Have you ever wanted to observe someone and know what they are thinking? Do you wish you could take control of a situation by gaining the upper hand? Are you ready to &lt;u&gt;discover what it takes to master dark psychology and use body language to your advantage&lt;/u&gt;?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We all do it. We smile when we are happy, frown and grimace when we are upset or put off. Our body reflects our emotions and the things that we are thinking. It&amp;rsquo;s how people communicated with each other before language was formed, and now it&amp;rsquo;s easy to look at someone and get a good idea of what they are thinking and feeling. When you start to understand how people communicate without speaking, you can then take advantage of the situation for your own benefit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Reading a person&amp;rsquo;s body language is a lot easier than you can imagine. This book gets into the details of what certain gestures, postures, and facial expressions really mean. And when you are needing to go through a person to get what you want, there is nothing better than knowing their body language in order to get the upper hand. And that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;ll learn in &lt;i&gt;Body Language: How to Analyze People, Have Greater Influence &amp;amp; Speed-Read People - Dark Psychology &amp;amp; NLP Techniques&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
