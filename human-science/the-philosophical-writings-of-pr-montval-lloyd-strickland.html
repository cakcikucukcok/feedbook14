  <title>The Philosophical Writings of Prémontval - Lloyd Strickland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This volume contains the key philosophical writings of maverick Enlightenment philosopher Andr&amp;eacute;-Pierre Le Guay de Pr&amp;eacute;montval (1716-1764). Pr&amp;eacute;montval was a prolific member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences, and in his career as academic he wrote a series of essays and books on a range of core philosophical topics, such as necessity and contingency, free will, sufficient reason, personal identity, the nature of the mind and its relationship with the body, optimism, and the existence of God. Pr&amp;eacute;montval&amp;rsquo;s philosophy, shaped by his opposition to key philosophers such as Descartes, Leibniz, and Wolff, is notable for a number of original and often provocative positions on key philosophical issues of the time, which he supported by inventive critiques and a raft of novel arguments. In addition to developing a highly original proof for the existence of God based on the principles of atheism, Pr&amp;eacute;montval argued that all possible beings exist, and do so necessarily and therefore eternally; he insisted that the universe unfolded through an interplay of chance and necessity, its direction influenced by God but not under God&amp;rsquo;s direct control; and he considered free will a curse and the main impediment to the realization of the only aim fitting for God, which was to make all beings happy and holy as quickly as possible. His writings are notable for anticipating modern developments such as open theism, process theology, and animal theodicy. In this volume, Lloyd Strickland makes Pr&amp;eacute;montval&amp;rsquo;s key philosophical writings available in English for the first time. In making these translations, Strickland&amp;mdash;a well-respected translator of Leibniz&amp;rsquo;s work&amp;mdash;has consulted the original manuscripts to ensure the greatest accuracy, and as befits a scholarly edition, the texts are meticulously documented with copious annotations. Accompanying the texts is a substantial and informative introduction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
