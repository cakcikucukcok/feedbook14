  <title>Cape Cod - Henry David Thoreau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="First published in 1908, &quot;Cape Cod&quot; is a collection of articles by Henry David Thoreau based on numerous trips to the Cape in the early 1880s. A fantastic work that walks the reader through the beauty of Cape Cod and the natural wonders that surround it, this volume is not to be missed by lovers of nature writing. Henry David Thoreau (1817 - 1862) was an American poet, philosopher, essayist, abolitionist, naturalist, development critic, and historian. He was also a leading figure in Transcendentalism, and is best known for his book &quot;Walden&quot;, a treatise on simple living in a natural environment. Other notable works by this author include: &quot;The Landlord&quot; (1843), &quot;Reform and the Reformers&quot; (1846-48), and &quot;Slavery in Massachusetts&quot; (1854). Contents include: &quot;The Shipwreck&quot;, &quot;Stage-coach Views&quot;, &quot;The Plains Of Nauset&quot;, &quot;The Beach&quot;, &quot;The Wellfleet Oysterman&quot;, &quot;The Beach Again&quot;, &quot;Across the Cape&quot;, &quot;The Highland Light&quot;, &quot;The Sea and the Desert&quot;, and &quot;Provincetown&quot;. Many vintage books such as this are becoming increasingly scarce and expensive. We are republishing this volume now in an affordable, modern, high-quality edition complete with a specially commissioned new biography of the author." />
