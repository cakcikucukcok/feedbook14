  <title>Drug Addiction in Schools - Prof. Rajinder M. Kalra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Drug abuse has become very common among students in the university and schools. Drugs are being misused by students within the university for various reasons. The most common reason being stress. To cope with the competition and ever increasing work load of the program students resort to taking drugs either to relieve stress or to stay awake all night to study. Another reason for taking drugs is peer pressure, the pressure to fit in and try something new. Drugs have become fashionable, are easily available and students take it because they feel it is normal, just like having an alcoholic drink in a social gathering. They usually start with a mild drug and then move on to harder ones like cocaine and heroin. The unfortunate part in Indian universities is the lack of support system for the students. There is no focus on creating a positive environment for the students to relieve their stress and discuss their problems. Drugs are like a disease taking over our society with no end. I am deeply concerned with this situation. I am indebted to be invited to become volunteer assistant for such an important project. We will do whatever we can to assist in this project so that it can bring resolution to this epidemic in our society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
