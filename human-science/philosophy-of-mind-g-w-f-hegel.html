  <title>Philosophy of Mind - G.W.F. Hegel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I here offer a translation of the third or last part of Hegel&amp;#39;s encyclopaedic sketch of philosophy,&amp;mdash;the Philosophy of Mind. The volume, like its subject, stands complete in itself. But it may also be regarded as a supplement or continuation of the work begun in my version of his Logic. I have not ventured upon the&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Philosophy of Nature&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;which lies between these two. That is a province, to penetrate into which would require an equipment of learning I make no claim to,&amp;mdash;a province, also, of which the present-day interest would be largely historical, or at least bound up with historical circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;
The translation is made from the German text given in the Second Part of the Seventh Volume of Hegel&amp;#39;s Collected Works, occasionally corrected by comparison with that found in the second and third editions (of 1827 and 1830) published by the author. I have reproduced only Hegel&amp;#39;s own paragraphs, and entirely omitted the&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Zus&amp;auml;tze&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;of the editors. These addenda&amp;mdash;which are in origin lecture-notes&amp;mdash;to the paragraphs are, in the text of the Collected Works, given for the first section only. The psychological part which they accompany has been barely treated elsewhere by Hegel: but a good popular&amp;nbsp;exposition of it will be found in Erdmann&amp;#39;s&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Psychologische Briefe&lt;/i&gt;. The second section was dealt with at greater length by Hegel himself in his&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Philosophy of Law&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;(1820). The topics of the third section are largely covered by his lectures on Art, Religion, and History of Philosophy.&lt;br /&gt;
I do not conceal from myself that the text offers a hard nut to crack. Yet here and there, even through the medium of the translation, I think some light cannot fail to come to an earnest student. Occasionally, too, as, for instance, in &amp;sect;&amp;sect; 406, 459, 549, and still more in &amp;sect;&amp;sect; 552, 573, at the close of which might stand the words&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Liberavi animam meam&lt;/i&gt;, the writer really&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;lets himself go,&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;and gives his mind freely on questions where speculation comes closely in touch with life..." />
