      <meta name="description" content="Does God exist? Is there life after death? Do we have free wills? What is consciousness? Are animals and computers &quot;conscious&quot;? Do we always think in words? Are people &quot;illogical&quot;? When can things be &quot;proved&quot;? What is the difference between &quot;knowledge&quot; and &quot;belief&quot;?
