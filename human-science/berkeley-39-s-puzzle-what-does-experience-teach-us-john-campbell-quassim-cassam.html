  <title>Berkeley&#39;s Puzzle: What Does Experience Teach Us? - John Campbell, Quassim Cassam</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sensory experience seems to be the basis of our knowledge and conception of mind-independent things. The puzzle is to understand how that can be: even if the things we experience (apples, tables, trees etc), are mind-independent how does our sensory experience of them enable us to conceive of them as mind-independent? George Berkeley thought that sensory experience can only provide us with the conception of mind-dependent things, things which cannot
exist when they aren&#39;t being perceived. 
It&#39;s easy to dismiss Berkeley&#39;s conclusion but harder to see how to avoid it. In this book, John Campbell and Quassim Cassam propose very different solutions to Berkeley&#39;s Puzzle. For Campbell, sensory experience can be the basis of our knowledge of mind-independent things because it is a relation, more primitive than thought, between the perceiver and high-level objects and properties in the mind-independent world. Cassam opposes this &#39;relationalist&#39; solution to the Puzzle and defends
a &#39;representationalist&#39; solution: sensory experience can give us the conception of mind-independent things because it represents its objects as mind-independent, but does so without presupposing concepts of mind-independent things.
This book is written in the form of a debate between two rival approaches to understanding the relationship between concepts and sensory experience. Although Berkeley&#39;s Puzzle frames the debate, the questions addressed by Campbell and Cassam aren&#39;t just of historical interest. They are among the most fundamental questions in philosophy." />
