  <title>Spanish Speakers in the USA - Janet M. Fuller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Spanish Speakers in the USA explores the relationship between language and culture both as specific to Latin@s and as a generalizable example of linguistic and cultural diversity. The concept of identity is explored, with special attention to culturally embedded ideas about &#39;race&#39; and ethnicity, and how language contributes to identity construction. Also addressed are attitudes and beliefs about the Spanish language, and the people who speak it, as they are revealed in online communication, public discourse, films and television. Linguistic consequences of language contact are discussed, showing how so-called &#39;Spanglish&#39; is both socially significant and linguistically mundane. The final chapter illuminates how the education of Spanish speakers in the USA school system is linked to issues surrounding Latin@ identities and ideologies about Spanish." />
