  <title>An American History Lesson and a Wake up Call for America - Jack B. Walters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;These articles and book reports have been written in the hope that readers could believe as I do that the world, including our country, is in great danger for multiple of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1.	The spread of adherents to Islam threaten to engulf all persons of different faiths. They are winning through violence but also just by having more babies than every other culture. The leaders of Europe and America refuse to accept how evil this belief system is and how they have only one agendaand that is to have dominion over all nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.	Our Constitution has been destroyed by the administration of President Obama and the Supreme Court. He does whatever he wants regardless of the Congress. The Court extended the commerce authority to allow the government to force citizens to purchase a service and allowed the corporations to spend anything they want to affect the outcome of elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3.	We are drowning in debt but continue to add costly programs, making it even worse without making any attempt to reduce the strain. Military adventures continue without end. Government handouts to the so-called needy have created a permanent underclass of people being supported while not required to put forth effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.	The government refuses to take the steps needed to become energy efficient, which could be accomplished easily, thereby freeing us from OPEC. For those of you who dont remember, in the 50s, we exported oil.&lt;/p&gt;" />
