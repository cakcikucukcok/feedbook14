  <title>Insignificant Me! - Ruth Washington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Well, it is the year and the time I dread the most.  It is the Presidential election year, where we elect or appoint a President for the next four years.  It is a time we are forced to endure as we listen to all the lies, promises, innuendo, etc.  Why can&#39;t the politicians we have campaigning for office simply tell us what their plans are for making our lives easier?  I&#39;ll tell you why, because they simply don&#39;t have a plan.  Don&#39;t waste my time telling me what Joe Blow has not done for me!  Simply state your plans if you have any, and allow me to make the decision of who do I think will do the best job for the Country or who is the lesser of two evils.  As a cousin of mine used to say often times, &quot;Playing upon my little intelligence!&quot;
I liked the fact that all the Republican Debates were not on every network.  Don&#39;t automatically assume everyone wants to hear all this rhetoric on every network.  Each network should take turns donating time to the candidates and debates.  In this way, those who are interested can tune in and those not interested can do something else.
One of my pet peeves concerns the amount of money spent to make the public believe all the lies, promises, innuendo and rhetoric told to us.  What is even more disturbing is how gullible some of us are.  Why isn&#39;t that money spent to pay down the deficit?  If the politicians are truly concerned about the deficit, isn&#39;t this a viable start on reducing the deficit?
Opinions are like ass....s, everybody has one and these are a few of my own." />
