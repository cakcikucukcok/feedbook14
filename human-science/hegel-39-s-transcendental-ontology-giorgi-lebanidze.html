  <title>Hegel&#39;s Transcendental Ontology - Giorgi Lebanidze</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;The book argues that Hegel offers the kernel of his ontology in the final part of the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt; Science of Logic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the Doctrine of the Concept. The Concept consists of three moments: universality, the activity of generation of empirical concepts that is guided by the determinations of reflection; particularity, the systematically related constellation of empirical concepts; and individuality, the objects that are individuated through these concepts. The book spells out in detail these three moments as well as the specific schema of their relation to one another. One of the aims of this work is to offer a resolution to the recent debate between Kantian and traditional metaphysics-based readings of Hegel that has been dominating Hegel scholarship. It demonstrates that each one of the sides is partially right, but also partially misguided as Hegel is putting forward a metaphysics theory, but at the same time this theory is Kantian through and through. The book lays out the detailed account of the path walked by Hegel between the Scylla of offering one more metaphysical theory in the spirit of Leibniz and his followers while having turned a blind eye to the devastating attack Kant submitted traditional metaphysics to and Charybdis of abstaining from making any substantial claim about the nature of reality and focusing exclusively on the analysis of the faculty of understanding.&lt;/span&gt;" />
