  <title>Internet Addiction - Juan Moises de la Serna</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Technology is more and more present in our lives, which is a clear advance, but also a danger, especially among the youngest people, since they can fall into what is called CyberAddiction.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This has become a reality today, a health problem that did not exist only a decade ago, and which is taking on new victims and more and more young people every day. Although the long-term consequences are still unknown, the fact that some studies indicate that 30% of young people who use the Internet on a daily basis are at risk of suffering from behavioral addiction means that one in three is at risk. While some countries are beginning to take steps to prevent it, in others they have not yet realized the gravity of the situation, hence the need to disseminate the results of recent research in this regard to give visibility to a social problem that requires both preventive and treatment measures.&lt;br /&gt;
