  <title>Risk in Academic Writing: Postgraduate Students, their Teachers and the Making of Knowledge - Lucia Thesen, Linda Cooper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book brings together a variety of voices - students and teachers, journal editors and authors, writers from the global north and south - to interrogate the notion of risk as it applies to the production of academic writing. Risk-taking is viewed as a productive force in teaching, learning and writing, and one that can be used to challenge the silences and erasures inherent in academic tradition and convention. Widening participation and the internationalisation of higher education make questions of language, register, agency and identity in postgraduate writing all the more pressing, and this book offers a powerful argument against the further reinforcement of a &#39;northern&#39; Anglophone understanding of knowledge and its production and dissemination. This volume will provide food-for-thought for postgraduate students and their supervisors everywhere." />
