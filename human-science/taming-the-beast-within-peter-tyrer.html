  <title>Taming the Beast Within - Peter Tyrer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Foreword by Stephen Fry&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Controversy and confusion surround personality disorder (PD). Long dismissed as impossible to treat, PD has become a catch-all for various conditions, abounding with negative stereotypes and incorrect information.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Now, revised and simpler classifications devised for the World Health Organization (WHO) should make diagnosis and treatment more straightforward. This book, by Professor Peter Tyrer, chair of the advisory body for the WHO, presents new ways of looking at personality. Taming the Beast Within explores the strengths as well as the difficulties of personality, so that all can come to an informed and tolerant understanding of PD.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Topics include:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;what personality is&lt;BR&gt;‘normal’ and ‘abnormal’ personalities&lt;BR&gt;how mental illness differs from personality disorder&lt;BR&gt;politics and personality&lt;BR&gt;the roots of disturbance&lt;BR&gt;types of disorder, including borderline personality disorder&lt;BR&gt;helping yourself and others&lt;BR&gt;nidotherapy and other approaches &lt;BR&gt;drug treatments&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Professor Peter Tyrer says, ‘I hope this book will help people with PD, their families and friends, and everyone involved in managing this very common condition. Using our personality strengths, and accepting that some difficulties with others may be self-generated, are the key to understanding. The title of this book can then be changed – no longer a beast within, just a pussy cat!’&lt;/P&gt;" />
