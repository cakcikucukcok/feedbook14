  <title>Understanding Hegel&#39;s Mature Critique of Kant - John McCumber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hegel&#39;s critique of Kant was a turning point in the history of philosophy: for the first time, the concrete, situated, and in certain senses &quot;naturalistic&quot; style pioneered by Hegel confronted the thin, universalistic, and argumentatively purified style of philosophy that had found its most rigorous expression in Kant. The controversy has hardly died away: it virtually haunts contemporary philosophy from epistemology to ethical theory. Yet if this book is right, the full import of Hegel&#39;s critique of Kant has not been understood. Working from Hegel&#39;s mature texts (after 1807) and reading them in light of an overall interpretation of Hegel&#39;s project as a linguistic, &quot;definitional&quot; system, the book offers major reinterpretations of  Hegel&#39;s views: The Kantian thing-in-itself is not denied but relocated as a temporal aspect of our experience. Hegel&#39;s linguistic idealism is understood in terms of his realistic view of sensation. Instead of claiming that Kant&#39;s categorical imperative is too empty to provide concrete moral guidance, Hegel praises its emptiness as the foundation for a diverse society." />
