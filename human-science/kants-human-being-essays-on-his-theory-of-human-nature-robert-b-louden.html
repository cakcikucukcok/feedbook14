  <title>Kants Human Being: Essays on His Theory of Human Nature - Robert B. Louden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Kants Human Being, Robert  B. Louden continues and deepens avenues of research first initiated in his highly acclaimed book,  Kants Impure Ethics. Drawing on a wide variety of both published and unpublished works spanning all periods of Kants extensive writing career, Louden here focuses on Kants under-appreciated empirical work on human nature, with particular attention to the connections between this body of work and his much-discussed ethical theory. Kant repeatedly claimed that the question, What is the human being is philosophys most fundamental question, one that encompasses all others. Louden analyzes and evaluates Kants own answer to his question, showing how it differs from other accounts of human nature.   This collection of twelve essays is divided into three parts. In Part One (Human Virtues), Louden explores the nature and role of virtue in Kants ethical theory, showing how the conception of human nature behind Kants virtue theory results in a virtue ethics that is decidedly different from more familiar Aristotelian virtue ethics programs. In Part Two (Ethics and Anthropology), he uncovers the dominant moral message in Kants anthropological investigations, drawing new connections between Kants work on human nature and his ethics. Finally, in Part Three (Extensions of Anthropology), Louden explores specific aspects of Kants theory of human nature developed outside of his anthropology lectures, in his works on religion, geography, education ,and aesthetics, and shows how these writings substantially amplify his account of human beings.  Kants Human Being offers a detailed and multifaceted investigation of the question that Kant held to be the most important of all, and will be of interest not only to philosophers but also to all who are concerned with the study of human nature." />
