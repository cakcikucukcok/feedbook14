  <title>Symphony #1 in a Minor Key - Alan A. Block</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When instruments are harmoniously joined together, beautiful music ensues. Just as in a classic symphony, life often occurs in phases, or movements. In his creative comparison &lt;i&gt;Symphony #1 in a Minor Key&lt;/i&gt;, literary exegete Alan Block shares his philosophies on four movements reflected in his own life, each loosely modeled on a different musical form linked to the emotions of a life both fully lived and joyously celebrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first movement, Sonata Allegro, Block juxtaposes biblical stories with personal experiences as he explores the contradictory nature of what it means to leave home in search of another home. In the second movement, representing a slow march to and from the grave, he focuses his examination on the funerals of three very different people from a Jewish perspective. In strong contrast, Block presents a glimpse into his absurd daily world in the third movement, punctuated by jokes and commentary. Finally, he shares a celebration of life and hope inspired by the final movement of Beethovens Seventh Symphony, encouraging others to be open to the sublime and realize that none of our worlds is perfect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Symphony #1 in a Minor Key&lt;/i&gt; shares one mans reflections as he offers a fascinating meditation on life, death, and everything in between. &lt;/p&gt;" />
