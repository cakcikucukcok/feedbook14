  <title>Agency: Moral Identity and Free Will - David Weissman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is agency in all we do: thinking, doing, or making. We invent a tune, play, or use it to celebrate an occasion.&amp;nbsp; Or we make a conceptual leap and ask more abstract questions about the conditions for agency. They include autonomy and self-appraisal, each contested by arguments immersing us in circumstances we don&amp;rsquo;t control.&amp;nbsp; But can it be true we that have no personal responsibility for all we think and do?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Agency: Moral Identity and Free Will&amp;nbsp;proposes that deliberation, choice, and free will emerged within the evolutionary history of animals with a physical advantage: organisms having cell walls or exoskeletons had an internal space within which to protect themselves from external threats or encounters.&amp;nbsp; This defense was both structural and active: such organisms could ignore intrusions or inhibit risky behavior.&amp;nbsp; Their capacities evolved with time: inhibition became the power to deliberate and choose the manner of one&amp;rsquo;s responses.&amp;nbsp; Hence the ability of humans and some other animals to determine their reactions to problematic situations or to information that alters values and choices.&amp;nbsp; This is free will as a material power, not as the conclusion to a conceptual argument.&amp;nbsp; Having it makes us morally responsible for much we do. It prefigures moral identity.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Closely argued but plainly written,&amp;nbsp;Agency: Moral Identity and Free Will&amp;nbsp;speaks for autonomy and responsibility when both are eclipsed by ideas that embed us in history or tradition.&amp;nbsp; Our sense of moral choice and freedom is accurate. We are not altogether the creatures of our circumstances.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;" />
