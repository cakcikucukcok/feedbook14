I am full of admiration.&quot; &amp;#8212;Philip Roth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;One of America&amp;#8217;s most important novelists&quot; (&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;), the award-winning, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The History of Love&lt;/em&gt;, conjures an achingly beautiful and breathtakingly original novel about personal transformation that interweaves the stories of two disparate individuals&amp;#8212;an older lawyer and a young novelist&amp;#8212;whose transcendental search leads them to the same Israeli desert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jules Epstein, a man whose drive, avidity, and outsized personality have, for sixty-eight years, been a force to be reckoned with, is undergoing a metamorphosis. In the wake of his parents&amp;#8217; deaths, his divorce from his wife of more than thirty years, and his retirement from the New York legal firm where he was a partner, he&amp;#8217;s felt an irresistible need to give away his possessions, alarming his children and perplexing the executor of his estate. With the last of his wealth, he travels to Israel, with a nebulous plan to do something to honor his parents. In Tel Aviv, he is sidetracked by a charismatic American rabbi planning a reunion for the descendants of King David who insists that Epstein is part of that storied dynastic line. He also meets the rabbi&amp;#8217;s beautiful daughter who convinces Epstein to become involved in her own project&amp;#8212;a film about the life of David being shot in the desert&amp;#8212;with life-changing consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Epstein isn&amp;#8217;t the only seeker embarking on a metaphysical journey that dissolves his sense of self, place, and history. Leaving her family in Brooklyn, a young, well-known novelist arrives at the Tel Aviv Hilton where she has stayed every year since birth. Troubled by writer&amp;#8217;s block and a failing marriage, she hopes that the hotel can unlock a dimension of reality&amp;#8212;and her own perception of life&amp;#8212;that has been closed off to her. But when she meets a retired literature professor who proposes a project she can&amp;#8217;t turn down, she&amp;#8217;s drawn into a mystery that alters her life in ways she could never have imagined. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bursting with life and humor, &lt;em&gt;Forest Dark&lt;/em&gt; is a profound, mesmerizing novel of metamorphosis and self-realization&amp;#8212;of looking beyond all that is visible towards the infinite.&lt;/p&gt;" />
