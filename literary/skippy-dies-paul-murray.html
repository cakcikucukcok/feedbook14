  <title>Skippy Dies - Paul Murray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Why does Skippy, a fourteen-year-old boy at Dublin&#39;s venerable Seabrook College, end up dead on the floor of the local doughnut shop?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could it have something to do with his friend Ruprecht Van Doren, an overweight genius who is determined to open a portal into a parallel universe using ten-dimensional string theory?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could it involve Carl, the teenage drug dealer and borderline psychotic who is Skippy&#39;s rival in love?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or could &quot;the Automator&quot;--the ruthless, smooth-talking headmaster intent on modernizing the school--have something to hide?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why Skippy dies and what happens next is the subject of this dazzling and uproarious novel, unraveling a mystery that links the boys of Seabrook College to their parents and teachers in ways nobody could have imagined. With a cast of characters that ranges from hip-hop-loving fourteen-year-old Eoin &quot;MC Sexecutioner&quot; Flynn to basketballplaying midget Philip Kilfether, packed with questions and answers on everything from Ritalin, to M-theory, to bungee jumping, to the hidden meaning of the poetry of Robert Frost, &lt;i&gt;Skippy Dies &lt;/i&gt;is a heartfelt, hilarious portrait of the pain, joy, and occasional beauty of adolescence, and a tragic depiction of a world always happy to sacrifice its weakest members. As the twenty-first century enters its teenage years, this is a breathtaking novel from a young writer who will come to define his generation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
