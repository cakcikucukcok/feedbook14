  <title>Devotion - Howard Norman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;A &amp;ldquo;striking, beautifully rendered&amp;rdquo; novel of love gone wrong, by the author of National Book Award finalist &lt;I&gt;The Bird Artist&lt;/I&gt; (&lt;I&gt;The Washington Post Book World&lt;/I&gt;).&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;I&gt;Devotion &lt;/I&gt;is an unconventional love story that begins with the recounting of an unlikely crime.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; Shortly after his marriage to Maggie Field, David Kozol and his father-in-law, William, came to blows on a London sidewalk. William stumbled backward into the path of a taxi, and eleven months later he is still convalescing&amp;mdash;and begrudgingly accepting David&amp;rsquo;s assistance.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; Estranged from Maggie and desperate to get her back, David has taken over William&amp;rsquo;s job as caretaker of a large rural estate on the Bay of Fundy in Nova Scotia. There, he tends to the main house, his father-in-law, and the resident flock of cranky, impertinent swans. The love between him and Maggie had been instantaneous and intense, and her absence is a constant reminder of how real and enduring it is. But sometimes small things lead to big damages, and strenuous effort is required for even the chance of recovery.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;ldquo;Rarely has such a short novel touched on so many important truths or probed such operatic depths.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;&lt;I&gt;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;ldquo;Any novel by Howard Norman is cause for celebration.&amp;#160;.&amp;#160;.&amp;#160;.
