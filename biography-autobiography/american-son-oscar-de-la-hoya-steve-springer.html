  <title>American Son - Oscar De La Hoya, Steve Springer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Oscar De La Hoya, one of the most celebrated fighters in the history of boxing, comes a frank and touching memoir about achieving the American Dream: his rise to the top, the power of a solid work ethic, his mother&#39;s painful death from cancer, the pitfalls of stardom, and a very personal take on what it means to be an American &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The son of Mexican-born parents, Oscar &quot;The Golden Boy&quot; De La Hoya has had an astonishing career. From boxing to business, from the recording industry to the charitable accomplishments of his foundation, his success is a testament to what one can achieve in the United States. But who is this man who has changed the lives of so many? Who has imprinted a positive mark upon the sport of boxing, for which many have all but given up hope? Who has become a symbol of success for an entire community, without many heroes to call their own?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Son&lt;/em&gt; answers these questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born into a boxing family, De La Hoya has defeated more than a dozen world champions and won six world titles as well as an Olympic gold medal&amp;#8212;a moment forever marked in the memory of anyone who has followed his career. Yet within the maelstrom of this success lay a man whose earnest belief in the goodness of everyone around him sometimes led him to stray far from his intended path. This book &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; The Golden Boy, and he bares his most heartbreaking mistakes as well as his most stunning triumphs for all of the world to see. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This thrilling tale of an immigrant&#39;s son&amp;#8212;a quintessentially American story&amp;#8212;is the chronicle of an amazing journey that will provide readers with new insight into the private life of a figure who has to many reached iconic status.&lt;/p&gt;" />
