  <title>What the Night Moon Said - Eleanor Crowe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;What The Night Moon Said&lt;/i&gt; is a compilation of reflections, stories and convictions gathered over the years of the author&#39;s life. &lt;p&gt;
Kay Redfield Jamison is a Professor of Psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the author of &quot;Touched with Fire: Manic-Depressive Illness and the Artistic Temperament&quot;, and the co-author of the standard medical text on manic-depressive illness. She herself lives in this shadow. Ms. Jamison believes research and history provide evidence that, for many, the bipolar condition has been an influencing factor in fostering their artistic spirit. &lt;p&gt;
After being diagnosed in her thirties, the author of this book finally understood her craving for expression as she traveled through rapidly changing horizons in the hills and valleys of her life. &lt;p&gt;
Most of this book was conceived and written at night under the still, hovering presence of the moon, which - although a speck in the universe - gifted her with peace and stability in the darkest times. &lt;p&gt;
Anyone who has sat alone and silent during the night, with only the click of a key or scratch of a pen to mark the hours, will understand." />
