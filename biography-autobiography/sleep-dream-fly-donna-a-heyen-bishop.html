&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since childhood, I have been sensitive to the other side, as they say. I have had some pretty strange things happen to me throughout my life. To even talk of such things, someone might think you were &lt;em&gt;tu sei pazza&lt;/em&gt;, which in Italian means youre crazy. I wanted to write this book to let people know that this is not a curse or some freak event but a gift . The more open your mind is to the possibility of something beyond what we can see makes it easier, I feel, to accept what is happening and to not be afraid.&lt;/p&gt;" />
