  <title>War Stories for My Grandchildren - H.F. Jansen Estrup</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Storytelling at its best, this compelling memoir graphically portrays the scarred emotional landscape of young men who seek a place in the world by way of a military career. Exhausted shadows of the past are brought alive with uncommon eloquence as the author looks back on his youth brimming with innocence, idealism and patriotism.
A page turner, the book explores the complex nature of a man whose brave, daring and sometimes foolhardy exploits led to the essential task; building a scaffold of choices and attitudes by rendering meaning from the intractable depths of experience.
What in other hands might be a dreary tale of adolescent angst, betrayal and disillusion, takes on truly pyrotechnic energy, lifting his coming of age from the mundane to the profound.

&quot;...What I like best is the humanity of the speaker. Narrators 
often glorify themselves or the people they love and consequently 
attack those who might have ever hurt them slightly. 
It seems those authors do not approach their lives from a 
position of power. But this book is filled with real people 
with distinctive voices, made human and vulnerable by their 
standards and faults and are loved all the more for them by 
the reader. Especially wonderful is the perspective on the 
world, the philosophies and stories presented with reasoning 
throughout, as well as the various layers of actual war and 
the psychology of boy and manhood ... the raw, relatable, vivid
voice that is found inside ... the project is quite necessary 
and brilliant, and I hope it will come under the gaze of many a 
person interested at all in our worlds history or the 
intelligent wisdom of one who has lived.&quot;

In War Stories For My Grandchildren, the author vividly portrays 
how war is not always on the military battlefield. This unique book 
tells of war in all walks of life, be it young, old, personal, social or 
military. It connects the reader to war through the eyes and mind 
of the author who experienced these events as they unfolded. 
With a poignant view of the military, gained from a combined total 
of twenty plus years in the Air Force and Navy, he writes with the 
technical expertise of an insider and the wisdom acquired after 
five tours in Southeast Asia. Here&#39;s a bargain if I ever read one. 
The book contains about twenty different stories for the price of 
one book. Each story filled with a refreshingly honest point of view. 
Not just the blood and guts side of war but a deeper philosophical 
understanding of what it is, what it does, and how humanity can&#39;t 
seem to detach itself from it. Real life danger and excitement await 
the reader in stories like The Drowning of Helen Lee and Sea Dragon, 
as well as others. I&#39;m sure his Grandchildren will enjoy them all. I did! 
Highly recommended from a satisfied reader. Jd2/SFR" />
