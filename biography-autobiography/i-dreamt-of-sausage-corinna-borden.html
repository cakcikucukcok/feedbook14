  <title>I Dreamt of Sausage - Corinna Borden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Corinna Borden &lt;/b&gt; writes of her tumultuous path toward recovery from Hodgkins disease in &lt;i&gt;I Dreamt of Sausage&lt;/i&gt;. Though it is considered one of the most curable cancers, her search was an arduous one. Borden was not there to follow orders.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the moment of diagnosis, Borden invites the reader into her head. Along with her experiences with the Western system of health and healing, &lt;i&gt;I Dreamt of Sausage &lt;/i&gt;travels with the author from Ann Arbor, Michigan, to Tijuana, Mexico, as she investigates and experiences alternative forms of cancer treatment. Through her personal journal entries and inner-voice discussions, Borden immerses the reader in the emotional and spiritual challenges of cancer treatment with unflinching honesty.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I Dreamt of Sausage &lt;/i&gt; is divided into three parts: Body, Mind, and Spirit. Body introduces the patient, her diagnosis, and her experiences with chemotherapy. Mind delves further into Bordens frustrations with traditional cancer treatments and her decision to pursue alternative medical care. Spirit illustrates her newfound ability to witness her thoughts in any medical situation and her broader understanding of health.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I Dreamt of Sausage &lt;/i&gt;offers a unique perspective on illness. Borden illustrates the transformation an individual can take from being overwhelmed by physical suffering to choosing internal peace. As Borden says, The story is about recognizing the voices in your head and choosing which ones to listen to.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Survival behavior relates to ones personality characteristics. Corinnas book shares many of these factors and makes them easy to understand because she is a native who has lived the problem and can share her experience. It is real and practical and useful for those confronting cancer and other problems.&lt;br&gt;
Bernie Siegel, MD, author of &lt;i&gt;Faith, Hope &amp; Healing &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;365 Prescriptions for the Soul&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a MUST-read for anyone dealing with cancer or involved with anyone who is. What do you do when your life is shattered by a cancer diagnosis? What forms of treatment do you choose? Why did you get cancer in the first place? Follow one womans amazing journey as she shares her innermost thoughts and feelings on her quests for wellness.&lt;br&gt;
