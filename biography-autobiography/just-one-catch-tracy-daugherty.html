  <title>Just One Catch - Tracy Daugherty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The&lt;i&gt; New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling writer Tracy Daugherty  illuminates his most vital subject yet in this first biography of the &lt;i&gt;Catch-22&lt;/i&gt; author Joseph Heller&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joseph Heller was a Coney Island kid, the son of Russian immigrants, who went on to great fame and fortune. His most memorable novel took its inspiration from a mission he flew over France in WWII (his plane was filled with so much shrapnel it was a wonder it stayed in the air). Heller wrote seven novels, all of which remain in print. &lt;i&gt;Something Happened &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Good as Gold, &lt;/i&gt;to name two, are still considered the epitome of satire. His life was filled with women and romantic indiscretions, but he was perhaps more famous for his friendships--he counted Mel Brooks, Zero Mostel, Carl Reiner, Kurt Vonnegut, Norman Mailer, Mario Puzo, Dustin Hoffman, Woody Allen, and many others among his confidantes. In 1981 Heller was diagnosed with Guillain-Barré Syndrome, a debilitating syndrome that could have cost him his life. Miraculously, he recovered. When he passed away in 1999 from natural causes, he left behind a body of work that continues to sell hundreds of thousands of copies a year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Just One Catch &lt;/i&gt;is the first biography of Yossarian&#39;s creator.&lt;/p&gt;" />
