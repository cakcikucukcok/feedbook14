  <title>My Southern Home - William Wells Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The culmination of William Wells Brown&#39;s long writing career, &lt;i&gt;My Southern Home&lt;/i&gt; is the story of Brown&#39;s search for a home in a land of slavery and racism. Brown (1814-84), a prolific and celebrated abolitionist and writer often recognized as the first African American novelist for his &lt;i&gt;Clotel&lt;/i&gt; (1853), was born enslaved in Kentucky and escaped to Ohio in 1834. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this comprehensive edition, John Ernest acts as a surefooted guide to this seminal work, beginning with a substantial introduction placing Brown&#39;s life and work in cultural and historical context. Brown addresses from a post-emancipation vantage point his early experiences and understanding of the world of slavery and describes his travels through many southern states. The text itself is presented in its original form, while Ernest&#39;s annotations highlight its layered complexity and document the many instances in which Brown borrows from his own earlier writings and the writings of others to form an underlying dialogue. This edition sheds new light on Brown&#39;s literary craft and provides readers with the maps they need to follow Brown on his quest for home in the chaotic social landscape of American southern culture in the final decades of the nineteenth century.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
