  <title>Katrina - Dianne Langlois Dorsey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I love my nursing job and because of my job, I stayed in New Orleans, Louisiana to face Katrina, my worse nightmare. I had never known fear like that before, if I ever needed God it was then. And I never lost faith even in my fear. My biggest dream now is to build a home away from home. A new beginning, which comes from increased suffering, my crying for a year and wondering where were my family members. I now have to redirect myself to a new environment with living conditions I have to adjust too. But one thing I know, God is in my life - past, present, future, and forever. He never changes, and I love him for that; He never left me, even when I left him so many times. You see, Hes been my Husband, mother, father, sister, and brother in my time of need." />
