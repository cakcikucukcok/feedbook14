  <title>Young Orson - Patrick McGilligan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;A remarkable, eye-opening biography . . . McGilligan&amp;#8217;s Orson is a Welles for a new generation, [a portrait] in tune with Patti Smith&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Just Kids&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;A. S. Hamrah, Bookforum&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No American artist or entertainer has enjoyed a more dramatic rise than Orson Welles. At the age of sixteen, he charmed his way into a precocious acting debut in Dublin&amp;#8217;s Gate Theatre. By nineteen, he had published a book on Shakespeare and toured the United States. At twenty, he directed a landmark all-black production of &lt;em&gt;Macbeth&lt;/em&gt; in Harlem, and the following year masterminded the legendary WPA production of Marc Blitzstein&amp;#8217;s agitprop musical &lt;em&gt;The Cradle Will Rock&lt;/em&gt;. After founding the Mercury Theatre, he mounted a radio production of &lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt; that made headlines internationally. Then, at twenty-four, Welles signed a Hollywood contract granting him unprecedented freedom as a writer, director, producer, and star&amp;#8212;paving the way for the creation of &lt;em&gt;Citizen Kane&lt;/em&gt;, considered by many to be the greatest film in history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing on years of deep research, acclaimed biographer Patrick McGilligan conjures the young man&amp;#8217;s Wisconsin background with Dickensian richness and detail: his childhood as the second son of a troubled industrialist father and a musically gifted, politically active mother; his youthful immersion in theater, opera, and magic in nearby Chicago; his teenage sojourns through rural Ireland, Spain, and the Far East; and his emergence as a maverick theater artist. Sifting fact from legend, McGilligan unearths long-buried writings from Welles&amp;#8217;s school years; delves into his relationships with mentors Dr. Maurice Bernstein, Roger Hill, and Thornton Wilder; explores his partnerships with producer John Houseman and actor Joseph Cotten; reveals the truth of his marriage to actress Virginia Nicolson and rumored affairs with actresses Dolores Del Rio and Geraldine Fitzgerald (including a suspect paternity claim); and traces the story of his troubled brother, Dick Welles, whose mysterious decline ran counter to Orson&amp;#8217;s swift ascent. And, through it all, we watch in awe as this whirlwind of talent&amp;#8212;hailed hopefully from boyhood as a &amp;#8220;genius&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;collects the raw material that he and his co-writer, the cantankerous Herman J. Mankiewicz, would mold into the story of Charles Foster Kane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filled with insight and revelation&amp;#8212;including the surprising true origin and meaning of &amp;#8220;Rosebud&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;Young Orson is an eye-opening look at the arrival of a talent both monumental and misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;" />
