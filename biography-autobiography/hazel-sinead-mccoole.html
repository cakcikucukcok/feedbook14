  <title>Hazel - Sinead McCoole</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Until now Lady Lavery has been remembered for the numerous portraits by her husband, the painter John Lavery, celebrated in &quot;The Municipal Gallery Re-visited&#39; by W.B. Yeats, This first biography of Hazel tells the story the pictures cannot: ow a girl from boomtown Chicago became one of the most stylish society hostesses in London, and turned her husband&#39;s studio into a hub of Anglo-Irish diplomacy, from the 1921 Treaty negotiations through the tumultuous early years of the Irish Free State. Using hitherto-unpublished letters and scrapbooks assembled by Hazel herself, Sinead McCoole gives an intimate account of Hazel&#39;s artistic and political preoccupations, and of her extraordinary effect upon the male politicians of Ireland and Britain, for whom she and her salon often represented the only common ground.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;p&gt;Romance and politics converged in her relationships with two hard men of nationalist Ireland who each met violent deaths: Michael Collins, whose view on the Treaty were influenced by Hazel, and Kevin O&#39;Higgins, whose passionate letters to Hazel reveal the inner man beneath the political carapace. Hazel also forged durable social and political alliances with the pillars of British government - Winston Churchill, Ramsay MacDonald and Lord Londonderry among other - while relishing her friendships with leading writers and artists of the day such as George Bernard Shaw, J.M. Barrie, Lennox Robinson and Evelyn Waugh.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;p&gt;This lavishly illustrated, richly documented life of Lady Lavery relates how one beautiful American woman reinvented herself as &#39;a simple Irish girl&#39; came to personify Eirr on Ireland&#39;s banknotes, &#39;living and dying ... as though some ballad-singer had sung it all&#39;.&lt;/P&gt;" />
