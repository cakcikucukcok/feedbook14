  <title>Victor Hugo: His Life and Works - G. Barnett Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book treats of the life and works of Victor Hugo, the great poet and writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writings of Victor Hugo are so varied and multifarious, and many of them are so well known to English readers, that I have not deemed it necessary to subject them to a detailed analysis. At the same time, the reader unfamiliar with these powerful works will, I trust, be able to gather something of their purport and scope from the ensuing pages. As they have impressed all minds, moreover, by their striking originality, I thought that it would not be without its value if, while venturing to record my own impressions, I gave at the same time a representation of critical contemporary opinion upon them. Finally, it has been my object to present to the reader, within reasonable compass, a complete survey of the life and work of the most celebrated Frenchman of the nineteenth century. &lt;/p&gt;" />
