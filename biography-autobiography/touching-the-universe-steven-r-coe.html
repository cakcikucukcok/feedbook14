  <title>Touching the Universe - Steven R. Coe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been far away from city lights and noticed the stars like diamonds in the sky? Many people have, and have been deeply moved and amazed by the experience. &lt;i&gt;Touching the Universe&lt;/i&gt; chronicles the adventures of author Steve Coe as he shares his love of the night sky. Coe is willing to travel far and wide to view new vistas of the universe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each chapter in &lt;i&gt;Touching the Universe&lt;/i&gt; contains Coes observations of the night sky on each of the twenty nights he recalls in detail here. To set the scene for each of the nights, he discusses what led up to choosing each night; then he explains what he observed and learned as he perfected his observation skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Share with Coe the joy of getting away from the city lights and setting up a telescope under dark skies. Follow a comet as it brightens and forms a tail; see a star cluster or nebula that will take your breath away. Viewing the stars and galaxies that inhabit the night sky provides peace and calm in a way that isnt available anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;" />
