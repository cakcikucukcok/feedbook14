  <title>Remember - Roxanne Munsen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We love that we don&#39;t have to live an average life. Living as God&#39;s children is every bit an adventure! One highlight was when my husband became a self-employed daddy. A long period ensued without income, a mortgage, bills, and God. But, God was enough. The miracles beganincluding divine money depositsand we never paid a bill late!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, God has continued to bless our lives as we put Him first. He taught us about commandments, tithing, and attitudes. He usurped the doctor&#39;s plan to remove gills from our baby, guided us away from professional boxing, showed us what marriage and parenting are really about, demonstrated the power in Jesus&#39; blood, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a great blessing to have these wonderful memories. I have no doubt He craves an intimate relationship with you, too. Remember, God loves youright nowand wants to do great things through you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I would highly recommend this book to anyone that feels there is no hope in their lives or just to help them find their own paths.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sue, Mullan, Idaho (excerpt from the foreword)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Thank you so much for sharing your lives with us. It has encouraged us to keep faith during our trial.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill and Cheryl, Mayo Clinic, Arizona&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Remember is an amazing story that increases your faith in God&#39;s love, His provisions, and His blessings for your life!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
