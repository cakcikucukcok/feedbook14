  <title>I Am the Pterodactyl - Richard S. Kosoff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It has been said by many that we walk this way but once. We get older, and we realize our days are numbered. If we are fortunate, we have stories, hopefully more good than bad. I met a rabbi once. He explained that the Torah was our story as a people from the very beginning. He said everyone should have a Torah. Everyone should write their story for generations to come.
I felt inspired by this man with the black beard. And I feel blessed. I have a very good memory (still) and like the idea of writing my Torah. The following short stories, although not necessarily in order, and not always pious, are the stories of my life. I hope you enjoy them. And when done, maybe you can write your Torah for generations to come." />
