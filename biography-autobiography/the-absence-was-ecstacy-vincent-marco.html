  <title>The Absence Was Ecstacy - Vincent Marco</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Absence Was Ecstasy is a chronicle of a young, struggling addict and his triumph over countless internal demons. This memoir illuminates the foundational elements of dependency in all of their forms from love to lust, drugs, and alcohol. It showcases how even those born into privileged circumstances can fall victim to the undiscriminating grip of addiction and lose themselves entirely. Throughout immeasurable suffering and loss, the protagonist fights tirelessly to believe that humor can be found in any circumstance he encounters, matching each tear with a smile and pushing on. Above all, he fights to leave behind pieces of himself in those he loves, with hopes of being fondly remembered if ever he loses his fight.
In present day, with a bleeding heart and a hopeless romantic, the narrator finds himself staring down at another lovers ghost. Haunted by the vices and habits of his past, he searches endlessly for purpose and direction, as the underlying question on his tongue remains, What now?" />
