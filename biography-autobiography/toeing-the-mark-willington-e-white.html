  <title>Toeing the Mark - Willington E. White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dr. White is a product of a very dark period in American history -- segregation and racism: Jim Crow!  This was a period which limited the growth of African Americans in the southern region of the United States.  As a result, African Americans were denied opportunities to learn to read, write or become productive citizens.  These negatives were very apparent in his family.  Because of this void throughout most families, very little information was expressed concerning their lives, relationships, livelihoods, loves, losses, and ideas for the future.  As Dr. White began thinking of the &quot;information void&quot; about his ancestors, he wanted to tell his children and their children about his life and how he had achieved the American dream.
While his family may not face the same problems that he encountered, he hopes this memoir will encourage them to share their life experiences with their descendents." />
