  <title>The Formula - Bintell J.D. Powell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is no other subject that is more important to mankind, yet more illusive and misunderstood, than the subject of money and success. With all of their obvious importance to our well being, the average person knows very little about how to actually succeed and &amp;quot;make money&amp;quot; other than getting a job. Because jobs are at times a commodity in limited supply, this is not only a crisis of epidemic proportion, it&amp;#39;s simply not fair.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those with jobs are working themselves just shy of exhaustion each day, yet somehow they remain in debt, one paycheck away from financial disaster. There is a very quiet, small group of people that already posses this money formula you now hold in your hands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Knowing and using this simplistic formula already being utilized by the powerful elite is the answer. Between these pages, you will discover that YOU ARE INCREDIBLY TALENTED, YOUR PASSION IS INFINITELY VALUABLE, and YOU DO POSSESS GENIUS! This book not only answers the generational old question of how to succeed, it also explains why you must use THE FORMULA to explore your unlimited potential. Now, the people that need it most will have the single most valuable success secret of the rich. The American Dream is no longer just a dream. With THE FORMULA, it&amp;#39;s now a World Wide Reality!" />
