  <title>Bitter Spring - Stanislao G. Pugliese</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;One of the major figures of twentieth-century European literature, Ignazio Silone (1900-78) is the subject of this award-winning new biography by the noted Italian historian Stanislao G. Pugliese. A founding member of the Italian Communist Party, Silone took up writing only after being expelled from the PCI and garnered immediate success with his first book, &lt;i&gt;Fontamara&lt;/i&gt;, the most influential and widely translated work of antifascism in the 1930s. In World War II, the U.S. Army printed unauthorized versions of it, along with Silone&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Bread and Wine&lt;/i&gt;, and distributed them throughout Italy during the country&#39;s Nazi occupation. During the cold war, he was an outspoken opponent of Soviet oppression and was twice considered for the Nobel Prize in Literature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty years after his death, Silone was the object of controversy when reports arose indicating that he had been an informant for the Fascist police. Pugliese&#39;s biography, the most comprehensive work on Silone by far and the first full-length biography to be published in English, evaluates all the evidence and paints a portrait of a complex figure whose life and work bear themes with contemporary relevance and resonance. &lt;i&gt;Bitter Spring&lt;/i&gt;, the winner of the 2008 Fraenkel Prize in Contemporary History, is a memorable biography of one of the twentieth century&#39;s greatest writers against totalitarianism in all its forms, set amid one of the most troubled moments in modern history.&lt;/p&gt;" />
