  <title>Anything Impossible Is Possible - Miriam Limon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We all have a story to tell  this is my story, and its a story that was written from the heart.  This is about my search for my biological family and the reunion.  I hope you enjoy this and to all adoptees that read this, I hope it brings you some understanding of who you are and that we can believe that anything impossible is possible.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Anything Impossible is Possible&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is about my search for my biological family and how after 8 years we met.  There were many obstacles during my search, and there was a sense of betrayal from the family of my adopted mothers side for me to know the truth.   It wasnt easy but I was determined to keep going and find out who I was and where I came from.   During my search I learned a lot about myself, and that helped me continue my journey.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Every time it looked like things werent happening, I would remember a saying when the world says give up, hope whispers try it one more time.  That helped me keep going and bad thoughts went away.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My kids were a big part of my desire to keep going.  I wanted to leave them something to know who I am and how I grew up.  The values my adopted mother instilled in me at a young age made me who I am as an adult.  I lost my adopted father at age 14, and that made me grow up very quickly.  As difficult as that loss was for me, it made me a strong individual, and I am grateful for the love they both gave me for they were my true parents.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
No one can understand the feeling of voidness I had for years and it was due to the unknown answers of who I was.  Once I found my biological family all those feelings went away and I was happy with my life.  I have had other bumps in the road, but I no longer suffer abandonment issues, the feeling of insecurity and voidness in my soul.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is my story and why I am a true believer that &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;anything impossible is possible.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;" />
