  <title>All But My Life - Gerda Weissmann Klein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;All But My Life&lt;/i&gt; is the unforgettable story of Gerda Weissmann Klein&#39;s six-year ordeal as a victim of Nazi cruelty. From her comfortable home in Bielitz (present-day Bielsko) in Poland to her miraculous survival and her liberation by American troops--including the man who was to become her husband--in Volary, Czechoslovakia, in 1945, Gerda takes the reader on a terrifying journey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gerda&#39;s serene and idyllic childhood is shattered when Nazis march into Poland on September 3, 1939. Although the Weissmanns were permitted to live for a while in the basement of their home, they were eventually separated and sent to German labor camps. Over the next few years Gerda experienced the slow, inexorable stripping away of &quot;all but her life.&quot;  By the end of the war she had lost her parents, brother, home, possessions, and community; even the dear friends she made in the labor camps, with whom she had shared so many hardships, were dead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite her horrifying experiences, Klein conveys great strength of spirit and faith in humanity. In the darkness of the camps, Gerda and her young friends manage to create a community of friendship and love. Although stripped of the essence of life, they were able to survive the barbarity of their captors. Gerda&#39;s beautifully written story gives an invaluable message to everyone. It introduces them to last century&#39;s terrible history of devastation and prejudice, yet offers them hope that the effects of hatred can be overcome.&lt;/p&gt;" />
