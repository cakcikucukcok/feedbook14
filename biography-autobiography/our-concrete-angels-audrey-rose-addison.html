  <title>Our Concrete Angels - Audrey Rose Addison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Who are our concrete Angels, you ask?
They are the pure innocence of this world. They are the children 
who are living with people whose only attention that is bestowed
upon them is pain and neglect. They are the children who are taughtat
a very young age how cruel the world can be. These are the
children that society wantsto hide. My book is written from the eyes of
a concrete Angel and we are not hiding anymore. The names in my bookhave
been changed to protect theinnocent but my words are true.My life is real.
My voice will now be heardbecause I want every child to know you
are not to blame and youdo not have to identify with how you were,
or are being treated. Remember let those who hurt you carry the pain, for
they bare the consequences of their actions, not you. This book is also for all those
who can make a difference in a childs life. Please let that be you!
