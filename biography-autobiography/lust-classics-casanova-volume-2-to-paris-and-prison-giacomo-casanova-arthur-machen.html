  <title>LUST Classics: Casanova Volume 2 - To Paris and Prison - Giacomo Casanova, Arthur Machen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;The Tribunal, having taken cognizance of the grave faults committed by G. Casanova primarily in public outrages against the holy religion, their Excellencies have caused him to be arrested and imprisoned under the Leads.&quot;
In this second volume about the adventurous life of Giacomo Casanova, the law finally catches up with him. Arrested for affront to religion and common decency, the womanizer faces five years in prison for his antics. One day, walking around the prison grounds, he finds an iron bar which he sharpens and uses as a tool to dig a pathway through the floorboards underneath his bed. Just two days before his planned escape, however, he gets transferred to a different cell.
A Charming and charismatic guy, it is no wonder it was Heath Ledger who portrayed him in Lasse Hallström‘s film `Casanova‘ from 2005.
