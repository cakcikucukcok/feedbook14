  <title>Unbeaten - Mike Stanton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Prince of Providence&lt;/i&gt;, a revelatory biography of Rocky Marciano, the greatest heavyweight champion of all time.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;The son of poor Italian immigrants, with short arms and stubby legs, Rocky Marciano accomplished a feat that eluded legendary heavyweight champions like Joe Louis, Jack Dempsey, Muhammad Ali, and Mike Tyson: He never lost a professional fight. His record was a perfect 49-0.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Unbeaten&lt;/i&gt; is the story of this remarkable champion who overcame injury, doubt, and the schemes of corrupt promoters to win the title in a bloody and epic battle with Jersey Joe Walcott in 1952. Rocky packed a devastating punch with an innocent nickname, &quot;Suzie Q,&quot; against which there was no defense. As the champ, he came to know presidents and movie stars - and the organized crime figures who dominated the sport, much to his growing disgust. He may have &quot;stood out in boxing like a rose in a garbage dump,&quot; as one sportswriter said, but he also fought his own private demons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the hands of the award-winning journalist and biographer Mike Stanton, &lt;i&gt;Unbeaten&lt;/i&gt; is more than just a boxing story. It&#39;s a classic American tale of immigrant dreams, exceptional talent wedded to exceptional ambitions, compromises in the service of a greater good, astounding success, disillusionment, and a quest to discover what it all meant. Like Suzie Q, it will knock you off your feet.&lt;/p&gt;" />
