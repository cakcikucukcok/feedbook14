  <title>Steven&#39;s Gift - Denise Willis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My Son My Angel My Eternal Connection to Heaven 
The true story of a sons lasting gift to his mother. 
Stevens Gift began the day Denises son Steven went home to heaven in 2003.  It delves into the depth of her connection with her son through his journey with cancer and their connection together before they were born.
Shortly after Steven passed, I received a book titled, The Little Soul and the Sun.  It came with a message from the sender: This is for Cody, it will help him through his grief as it tells the story of where it all begins, and hell soon understand the meaning of it all.  Naturally, I had to read the story myself, before giving it to my son, as I know how vastly different we all see things, especially where the topic of heaven, hell, god, and the angels are concerned.  At this point, I was still questioning all of this myself.  After reading the very first few pages, I immediately fell in love with the story as its lightness drew me in.  I found that a certain aspect of it really touched my spirit.  I was immediately taken back in time to a place in heaven, in which Steven and I had made our decision to both be born, and to share a life together.  I saw us there, sitting side by side, on a magnificent rock, surrounded by the most beautiful ocean, talking about our plans for our life together.  I then remembered exactly what I came here for." />
