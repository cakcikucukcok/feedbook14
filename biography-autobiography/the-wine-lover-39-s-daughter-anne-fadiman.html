  <title>The Wine Lover&#39;s Daughter - Anne Fadiman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Wine Lover&#39;s Daughter&lt;/i&gt;, Anne Fadiman examines--with all her characteristic wit and feeling--her relationship with her father, Clifton Fadiman, a renowned literary critic, editor, and radio host whose greatest love was wine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An appreciation of wine--along with a plummy upper-crust accent, expensive suits, and an encyclopedic knowledge of Western literature--was an essential element of Clifton Fadiman&#39;s escape from lower-middle-class Brooklyn to swanky Manhattan. But wine was not just a class-vaulting accessory; it was an object of ardent desire. &lt;i&gt;The Wine Lover&#39;s Daughter&lt;/i&gt; traces the arc of a man&#39;s infatuation from the glass of cheap Graves he drank in Paris in 1927; through the Château Lafite-Rothschild 1904 he drank to celebrate his eightieth birthday, when he and the bottle were exactly the same age; to the wines that sustained him in his last years, when he was blind but still buoyed, as always, by hedonism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wine is the spine of this touching memoir; the life and character of Fadiman&#39;s father, along with her relationship with him and her own less ardent relationship with wine, are the flesh. &lt;i&gt;The Wine Lover&#39;s Daughter&lt;/i&gt; is a poignant exploration of love, ambition, class, family, and the pleasures of the palate by one of our finest essayists.&lt;/p&gt;" />
