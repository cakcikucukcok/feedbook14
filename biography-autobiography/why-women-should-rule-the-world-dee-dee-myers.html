  <title>Why Women Should Rule the World - Dee Dee Myers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If women ruled the world, politics would be more collegial, businesses would be more productive, and communities would be healthier. More women should lead&amp;#8212;not because they are the same as men, but precisely because they are different. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on her own tenure as White House press secretary and her work as a political analyst, media commentator, and former consultant to NBC&#39;s &lt;em&gt;The West Wing&lt;/em&gt;, Dee Dee Myers blends memoir and social history with a call to action, as she assesses the crucial but long-ignored strengths that female leaders bring to the table. With intelligence, courage, candor, and wit, she looks at the obstacles women must overcome and the traps they must avoid on the path to success, and she challenges us to imagine a not-too-distant future with more women standing tall in the top ranks of politics, business, science, and academia.&lt;/p&gt;" />
