  <title>Heart Berries - Terese Marie Mailhot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&quot;Inside Terese Mailhot&#39;s phenomenal memoir &lt;i&gt;Heart Berries&lt;/i&gt;, the truth wrestles a knot between hustle and heart…. I am mesmerized by her lyricism because it is shot through with funny angry beautiful brutal truths. This is a writer for our times who simultaneously blows up time.&quot; —Lidia Yuknavitch, author of &lt;i&gt;The Book of Joan, The Small Backs of Children, Dora: A Headcase&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Chronology of Water&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Heart Berries&lt;/i&gt; is a powerful, poetic memoir of a woman&#39;s coming of age on an Seabird Island Indian Reservation in the Pacific Northwest. Having survived a profoundly dysfunctional upbringing only to find herself hospitalized and facing a dual diagnosis of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and Bipolar II; Terese Mailhot is given a notebook and begins to write her way out of trauma. The triumphant result is &lt;i&gt;Heart Berries&lt;/i&gt;, a memorial for Mailhot&#39;s mother, a social worker and activist who had a thing for prisoners; a story of reconciliation with her father––an abusive drunk and a brilliant artist––who was murdered under mysterious circumstances; and an elegy on how difficult it is to love someone while dragging the long shadows of shame. &lt;br&gt;
Mailhot &quot;trusts the reader to understand that memory isn&#39;t exact, but melded to imagination, pain, and what we can bring ourselves to accept.&quot; Her unique and at times unsettling voice graphically illustrates her mental state. As she writes, she discovers her own true voice, seizes control of her story, and, in so doing, re-establishes her connection to her family, to her people, and to her place in the world." />
