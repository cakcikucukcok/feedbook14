  <title>Queen Mother - Elizabeth Musoke Mubiru Md Facog</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rebecca Zirimbuga Musoke, nee Kisosonkole, was born into a life of privilege in an age-old African kingdom steeped in tradition.  Times changed when the kingdom was swallowed up by the British Empire and later absorbed into an independent African country.  The kingdom strove to maintain its identity through the turbulence of political coups and savage regimes bent on annihilating it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As Rebecca guided her young family through the perilous times, she held onto her faith that someday the kingdom would be restored and life would return to normal.  It came as a surprise to her when her cousin, the queen mother, passed away and Rebecca was named her heir.  After many years of bloodshed, times did change and the kingdom was restored.  When duty called, Rebecca rose to the challenge of becoming: The Mother of the Kingdom of Buganda (Namasole)!&lt;/p&gt;" />
