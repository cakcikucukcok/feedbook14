  <title>The Men We All Know - Stanley W. Howard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THE MEN WE ALL KNOW is about seven men that have had a positive influence on the Author Stanley W. Howard&#39;s life. These seven males are symbolic of men in all communities across this country that have given of themselves by living a positive life, taking care of their families, giving advice and just being there to help when and where ever needed. As we try to find answers for the growing number of African American males dropping out of high school, committing  crimes, not seeking a college education and going to prison, I feel the answer is right in our face; THE MEN WE ALL KNOW! These are stand up MEN who don&#39;t mind rolling up their sleeves, getting in the trenches, and going to work doing whatever it takes to guide our youth in the right direction." />
