  <title>My Lovely Wife in the Psych Ward - Mark Lukach</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;International Bestseller&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A heart-wrenching, yet hopeful, memoir of a young marriage that is redefined by mental illness and affirms the power of love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark and Giulia&amp;#8217;s life together began as a storybook romance. They fell in love at eighteen, married at twenty-four, and were living their dream life in San Francisco. When Giulia was twenty-seven, she suffered a terrifying and unexpected psychotic break that landed her in the psych ward for nearly a month. One day she was vibrant and well-adjusted; the next she was delusional and suicidal, convinced that&amp;#160;her loved ones were not safe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, Giulia fully recovered, and the couple had a son. But, soon after Jonas was born, Giulia had another breakdown, and then a third a few years after that. Pushed to the edge of the abyss, everything the couple had once taken for granted was upended. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A story of the fragility of the mind, and the tenacity of the human spirit, &lt;em&gt;My Lovely Wife in the Psych Ward&lt;/em&gt; is, above all, a love story that raises profound questions: How do we care for the people we love? What and who do we live for? Breathtaking in its candor, radiant with compassion, and written with dazzling lyricism, Lukach&amp;#8217;s is an intensely personal odyssey through the harrowing years of his wife&amp;#8217;s mental illness, anchored by an abiding devotion to family that will affirm readers&amp;#8217; faith in the power of love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
