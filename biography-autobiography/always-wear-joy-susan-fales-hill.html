  <title>Always Wear Joy - Susan Fales-Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From an inside peek at the inner workings of Hollywood to the backstage drama of Broadway, from a poignant look at the black upper class to an honest look at the WASP elite, this elegantly wrought memoir of an extraordinary family has something for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up with a black Auntie Mame-like mother (who performed with the likes of Lena Horne) and an Anglo sea-faring father, Susan Fales-Hill moved seamlessly between many worlds. But it was from her mother -- a woman who was dressed by Givenchy and sculpted by Alexander Calder, yet rejected by many a casting agent for her &quot;dark,&quot; unconventional looks -- that Susan drew inspiration, particularly when she faced challenges in her own career as a television writer in Hollywood, a town that wasn&#39;t always receptive to positive images of people of color. As a result the two developed a bond that mothers and daughters everywhere will find inspiring. Both a universally touching mother-daughter story and a portrait of a dazzling American family, &lt;em&gt;Always Wear Joy&lt;/em&gt; is a memoir readers won&#39;t soon forget.&lt;/p&gt;" />
