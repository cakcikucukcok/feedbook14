  <title>My Journey Through Time - Pauline Parkin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;At the age of seventeen, Pauline Parkin fell in love with an American soldier who was serving in her native England. After a brief courtship, they married. An emotional upheaval ensued when the teenage bride left her home and family in England to begin her new life in the United States. Now, she shares her story in &lt;i&gt;My Journey through Time&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Evoking both tears and smiles along the way, Pauline offers an in-depth look at the times of her life. Dealing long-distance with the illnesses and, ultimately, deaths of her parents, Pauline shares the range of feelings that she experienced as she and her husband built their new lives together in her new country. Then, abruptly their lives change as well, and their marriage comes to an end. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The end of her marriage leaves her struggling with two children. Without family support or work experience, she boldly reinvents herself as head of the household. As a single mother, her determination enables her to work two jobs and long hours, sometimes fourteen-hour days. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Paulines life story offers a moving and inspiring testament to the strength of the human spirit.&lt;/p&gt;" />
