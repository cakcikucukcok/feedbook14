  <title>Mrs Keppel - Tom Quinn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For Alice Keppel, it was all about appearances. Her precepts were those of the English upper classes: discretion, manners and charm. Nothing else mattered - especially when it came to her infamous affair with King Edward VII.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the King&#39;s favourite mistress up until his death in 1910, Alice held significant influence at court and over Edward himself. But it wasn&#39;t just Edward she courted: throughout her life, Alice enthusiastically embarked on affairs with bankers, MPs, peers - anybody who could elevate her standing and pay the right price. She was a shrewd courtesan, and her charisma and voracity ensured her both power and money, combined as they were with an aptitude for manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;Drawing on a range of sources, including salacious first-hand eyewitness accounts, bestselling author Tom Quinn paints an extraordinary picture of the Edwardian aristocracy, and traces the lives of royal mistresses down to Alice&#39;s great-granddaughter, the current Duchess of Cornwall. Both intriguing and astonishing, this is an unadulterated glimpse into a hidden world of scandal, decadence and debauchery.&lt;/p&gt;" />
