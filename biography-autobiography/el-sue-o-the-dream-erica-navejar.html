  <title>El Sueño, the Dream - Erica Navejar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Planned by her parents, a young girl is born in the United States of America in early 1974 to help her parents gain permanent residency in the United States through a law that allows Mexican natives to apply for permanent residency if a child is born in America. Although it takes a few years to gain permanent residency, her parents do not give up on their dream for a better life for their children. Facing hardship in Mexico and a father who leaves the family to work in the US illegally to make ends meet, some discouragement lingers, but the family receives new from the American Council of their acceptance for permanent residency.
Parents move into the States with their dream. They soon discover that it is hard to make it in America. Not only to survive but to keep their culture alive. When the young girl begins school, she is challenged by a language that is unknown and difficult to learn. The young girl begs mother not to send her to school and is granted that request for a short time. However, her mothers dream for her young daughter to become something in the land of opportunity is pressed, and the young girl has to conform to the American way even though she is a minority and customs and traditions are threatened by a new culture." />
