  <title>Resilience in the Face of Adversity - Margaret Ellen Mayo Tolbert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In her revealing autobiography, Dr. Tolbert describes how she overcame the obstacles that threatened to derail her aspirations for a sound education and professional career. From humble beginningssurrounded by dirt roads and segregated schools, left orphaned and penniless at an early ageshe chose a path of hard work and diligent study that lifted her out of poverty, despair, and ignorance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an era of tense race relations, and despite numerous stumbling blocks, Dr. Tolbert rose to prominence as an African-American scientist, educator, and administratoroften in positions traditionally held by males. She eventually became: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The first African-American female to serve as director of the nations New Brunswick Laboratory.   The first African-American female appointed director of education at Argonne National Laboratory.   The first female to serve as director of the Carver Research Foundation of Tuskegee Institute.   One of six African-American senior executives at the National Science Foundation.   The second African-American to graduate from Brown University with a doctorate in biochemistry.   The first member of the Mayo family of Suffolk, Virginia, to earn a doctoral degree. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her journey, however, was no crystal stair. In publishing her tale, Dr. Tolbert affirms our human ability to survive the unexpected, rally against adversity, and charge ahead on a path to personal accomplishment. She is a strong role model with an inspirational message for others struggling against overwhelming odds. &lt;/p&gt;" />
