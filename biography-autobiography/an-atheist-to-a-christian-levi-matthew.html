  <title>An Atheist to a Christian - Levi Matthew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Levi grew up as the kid who would never believe in anything.
His parents didnt take him to church, and it wasnt until he was seven years old that he began occasionally joining his friend Edwin to go to a house of God. But even then, he did not know much about God, Jesus or the Bible.
Spending time with Edwin and his family gave Levi a chance to escape his own unhappy home. He witnessed his mother cheating on his father and had to deal with his fathers verbal and physical abuse. Through it all, he just wanted to be loved like other children.
Levi went through high school drinking and struggling to fit in, and then he joined the Marines, all the while struggling to believe in God. Even when his son was thought to have Down syndromebut was born healthyhe shrugged it off as the doctors being wrong in their diagnosis.
The obstacles that Levi overcame and the wars he survived show that God loves everyoneeven those who dont love Him back. He shares how he opened his eyes and went from Atheist to Christian." />
