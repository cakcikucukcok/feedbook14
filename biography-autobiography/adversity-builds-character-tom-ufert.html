  <title>Adversity Builds Character - Tom Ufert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From an early age, author Tom Ufert can remember his grandmother proclaiming that adversity builds character. At the time, he didnt completely understand what it meantor know that he would actually live it. In &lt;i&gt;Adversity Builds Character&lt;/i&gt;, Ufert shares the events that altered and shaped his life and shows how, with Gods help, he was able to survive, thrive, and inspire others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this memoir, he narrates his life story and tells about the adversity he has facedhis mothers early divorces; the breakdown of his relationship with his sister; his adoption by family friends; his mothers illness and murder; his contact with a predatory pedophile; his questioning of his own sexuality, bisexuality, and eventual acceptance of being gay; alcoholism and sexual addiction; diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis and HIV; and paralysis from a car accident.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Revealing, honest, painful, and tender, &lt;i&gt;Adversity Builds Character&lt;/i&gt; communicates the power of the human spirit to overcome the trials of modern life. It shows how Uferts suffering paved the way for a deep appreciation for life and Gods role in the world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
