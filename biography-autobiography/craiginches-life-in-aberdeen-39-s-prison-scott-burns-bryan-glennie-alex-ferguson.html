  <title>Craiginches: Life in Aberdeen&#39;s Prison - Scott Burns, Bryan Glennie, Alex Ferguson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;CRAIGINCHES - &lt;i&gt;Life in Aberdeen&#39;s Prison&lt;/i&gt; is the story of this forbidding place from its early days to its recent closure, told by former prison officer Bryan Glennie. Having lived and breathed the life of the prison up to his retirement, this is the real inside story of rooftop riots, botched escapes, drugs being smuggled, prisoners brewing beer in dung heaps and the prison&#39;s only hanging, as well as dramatic tales of deployment to Peterhead when the SAS stormed D wing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Craiginches had another side too, with visits from Princess Anne, Robbie Shepherd, Charlie Nicholas, Evelyn Glennie and many more who have had a direct connection with the prison thanks to Bryan. All part of the constant efforts to rehabilitate as many prisoners as possible through events inside the prison and valuable conservation and community projects outside. And there&#39;s also Bryan&#39;s very special relationship with Sir Alex Ferguson which has endured through the decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a unique insight into prison life in Craiginches, showing both the difficulties and dangers that were a part of everyday life and the rewarding side of the job when inmates gave something positive back to society.&lt;/p&gt;" />
