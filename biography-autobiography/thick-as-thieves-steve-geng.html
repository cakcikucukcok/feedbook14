  <title>Thick As Thieves - Steve Geng</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A memoir about two siblings who loved each other (sometimes); the thrill of the shoplift, the power of the written word, the agony of addiction, and the joy of someone who understands you and still stays true&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve Geng--thief, addict, committed member of Manhattan&#39;s criminal semi-elite--was a rhapsody in blue, all on his own. Women had a tendency to crack his head open. His sister? Also unusual: Veronica Geng wrote brilliantly eccentric pieces for The New Yorker, hung with rock stars and Pulitzer Prize winners, threw the occasional typewriter, fled intimacy. They were parallel universes, but when they converged, it was . . . memorable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spanning decades of unresolved personal drama and rebellion, Steve Geng&#39;s memoir, Thick as Thieves, is the story of their lives, the bond between them, and all the things they shared. Raw, real, and funny, Geng follows his unique family history from Philadelphia to Paris, Greenwich Village to Riker&#39;s Island. We meet lovable, often treacherous characters (B.J. the Queen of Crime, Tina Brown). We hear the rants of the Geng&#39;s father, the Colonel; the malicious invective of publishing; the patter of hardened criminals. This is a memoir that will lift your spirit, kick you in the shins, and help you remember the person who understood you the most. Geng has made a lot of mistakes in his life. Thick as Thieves may just make up for them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
