As if that wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough, he then contracted a nearly fatal form of meningitis that called for the removal of all four limbs and visits to the burn unit. While in a coma, a mysterious visitor gave him the choice to live&amp;mdash;without the life he had planned&amp;mdash;or die.&lt;/p&gt;" />
