  <title>The King&#39;s Assassin - Benjamin Woolley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An absorbing account of the conspiracy to kill King James I by his handsome lover, the Duke of Buckingham, an historical crime that has remained hidden for 400 years.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The rise of George Villiers from minor gentry to royal power seemed to defy gravity. Becoming gentleman of the royal bedchamber in 1615, the young gallant enraptured James, Britain&#39;s first Stuart king, royal adoration reaching such an intensity that the king declared he wanted the courtier to become his &#39;wife&#39;. For a decade, Villiers was at the king&#39;s side - at court, on state occasions, and in bed, right up to James&#39;s death in March 1625.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost immediately, Villiers&#39; many enemies accused him of poisoning the king. A parliamentary investigation was launched, and scurrilous pamphlets and ballads circulated London&#39;s streets. But the charges came to nothing, and were relegated to a historical footnote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, new research suggests that a deadly combination of hubris and vulnerability did indeed drive Villiers to kill the man who made him. It may have been by accident - the application of a quack remedy while the king was weakened by a malarial attack. But there is compelling evidence that Villiers, overcome by ambition and frustrated by James&#39;s passive approach to government, poisoned him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The King&#39;s Assassin&lt;/i&gt;, acclaimed author Benjamin Woolley examines this remarkable, even tragic story. Combining vivid characterization and a strong narrative with historical scholarship and forensic investigation, Woolley tells the story of King James&#39;s death, and of the captivating figure at its center.&lt;/p&gt;" />
