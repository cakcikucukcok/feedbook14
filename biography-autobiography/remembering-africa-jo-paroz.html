  <title>Remembering Africa - Jo Paroz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt; After a 30-year career in New Mexico, it was time for a change, but what to
do next? That was the dilemma. Jo was seeking something unknown and unnamed until
she found her way to Africa, a place where she could live out her dream of
adventure and travel. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; &lt;B&gt;Remembering Africa: Moments in Time&lt;/B&gt; is the author&#39;s memoir of the two
years she lived in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, while teaching at an International
School with students and teachers from many different countries. Through her
personal stories, she portrays both the humor and struggle of daily life in Dar
and working at the International School there. She provides a window for the
reader to share her travel adventures to the exotic island of Zanzibar, the
Seychelles, Zimbabwe, Ethiopia, Namibia, and safari adventures into the
Serengeti, Ngorongoro Crater, etc. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; Jo was enchanted with the land and people of this amazing continent, and she
recorded events from those memorable years in a journal. When she returned to the
states, the memories of her life in Africa lingered and begged to be shared.
&lt;B&gt;Remembering Africa&lt;/B&gt; had to be written. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; The poem &quot;Moments in Time&quot;, written by Jo, was inspired by her experiences
while living and working in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. &lt;/P&gt;
