  <title>Eagle Minds - Alan M. Gillmor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Eagle Minds&lt;/i&gt;—a selection from the correspondence between the Canadian composer and scholar Istvan Anhalt and his American counterpart George Rochberg—is a splendid chronicle and a penetrating analysis of the swerving socio-cultural movements of a volatile half-century as observed by two highly gifted individuals. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Beginning in 1961 and spanning forty-four years, their conversation embraces not only music but other forms of contemporary art, as well as politics, philosophy, religion, and mysticism. The letters chronicle the deepening of their friendship over the years, and the openness, honesty, and genuine warmth between them provide the reader with an intimate look at their personalities. A fascinating intellectual tension emerges between the two men as they record their individual responses to musical modernism, to changing political and social realities, and to their Jewish heritage and sense of place, one as a son of Ukrainian immigrants to the United States, the other as a refugee from war-torn Hungary. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Allowing us a privileged glimpse into the private lives and thoughts of these fascinating men, &lt;i&gt;Eagle Minds&lt;/i&gt; is a valuable tool for scholars interested in North American composers in the late twentieth century and essential reading for anyone interested in the cultural and social history of that era. &lt;/p&gt;" />
