  <title>Peace in Truth - Rev. Carrie D. Larson Ma Ccht</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about learning everything we can from our lives. Every moment, waking or sleeping, has a message for us about who we are and what we are on the earth to do. It is exciting to understand this concept and to know how connected we really are to each other and to the universal energy that runs through all of us. We can be quiet in meditation and receive this great energy and knowledge. &lt;br /&gt;
Forgiveness can bring our purpose in life closer to being fulfilled. We are blessed with something to do in this life that will help others. This is like throwing a pebble into a still pond. The ripples of our actions in life can bring about wonderful growth and change in the entire world. Look at the influence parents have on children and multiply that by thousands. The world is ready for you. Are you ready to experience your own fulfillment?" />
