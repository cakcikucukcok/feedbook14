  <title>Cigar Box Banjo: Notes on Music and Life - Paul Quarrington, Roddy Doyle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;This eclectic, funny, and moving book tracks a life lived in music and words. &lt;B&gt;Paul Quarrington&lt;/B&gt; ruminates on the bands of his childhood; his restless youth, spent playing bass with the cult band Joe Hall and the Continental Drift; and his incarnation, in middle age, as rhythm guitarist and singer with the band Porkbelly Futures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ranging through rock &amp;#8217;n&amp;#8217; roll, the blues, folk, country and soul, he explores how songs are made, how they work, and why they affect us so deeply. This is also a book about friendship. In his imitably entertaining way, &lt;B&gt;Quarrington&lt;/B&gt; recounts the adventures and vicissitudes he and his fellow band members share as they cope with everything from broken strings to broken marriages, making a last stab at that elusive thing called success.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
