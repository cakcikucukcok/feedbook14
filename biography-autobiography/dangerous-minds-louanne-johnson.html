  <title>Dangerous Minds - Louanne Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;She bullied, bluffed, and bribed her students into caring about school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if that didn&#39;t work, the pretty, petite ex-marine told them she&#39;d been trained to kill with her bare hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were called the class from Hell-thirty-four inner city sophomores she inherited from a teacher who&#39;d been &quot;pushed over the edge.&quot; She was told &quot;those kids have tasted blood. They&#39;re dangerous.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But LouAnne Johnson had a different idea. Where the school system saw thirty-four unreachable kids, she saw young men and women with intelligence and dreams. When others gave up on them, she broke the rules to give them the best things a teacher can give-hope and belief in themselves. When statistics showed the chances were they&#39;d never graduate, she fought to beat the odds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is her remarkable story-and theirs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you loved &lt;i&gt;Stand and Deliver, &lt;/i&gt;you&#39;ll stand up and cheer for LouAnne Johnson and &lt;i&gt;Dangerous Minds.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
