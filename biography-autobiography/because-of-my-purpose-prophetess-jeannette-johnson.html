  <title>Because of My Purpose - Prophetess Jeannette Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt; &lt;i&gt;In Because of My Purpose: I Shall Not, Cannot, and Will Not Be Destroyed,&lt;/i&gt; Prophetess Jeannette Johnson explains some of the unanswered questions that each of us ponder as we consider our lives with God. These questions are simple but straightforward: Why does God allow us to go through so much? Why do we have to be discussed by our neighbors?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;At a young age, Johnson discovered that the answers to these questions were not simple; even so, once the answers were discovered, they provided the path to understanding who we are in Gods eyes. As we encounter lifes challenges, God brings insight to our lives concerning our purpose. Because of My Purpose seeks to help everyone understand that there is a purpose for everything under the sun. When each of us understands our purpose individually, we can approach our lives with great expectations of knowing how to fulfill our destinies.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Because of My Purpose: I Shall Not, Cannot, and Will Not Be Destroyed can help anyone with the will to do so discover who they are in Gods eyes and make good the will of God for their lives and for those whose lives they touch.&lt;/P&gt;" />
