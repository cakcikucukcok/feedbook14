  <title>A Sea Story - Charles R Johnstone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Right after WWll when the fighting was done and the burying was going on two men were attending a burial ceremony at Arlington national cemetery one was an army general and the other was a Navy Admiral. After The ceremony they remained behind and stood looking at the hundreds of snow white crosses and talking about the honor and courage of the men under those crosses the admiral asked the general where did we get such men?The general replied I don&amp;#39;t know but Thank God we have them. I don&amp;#39;t have the answer to that question either. But I will say this If or when it comes a time when such men do not answer our Country&amp;#39;s call then our further generations will be talking a different language. If there are any young people reading this please remember this. Honor is the only thing a person has that can&amp;#39;t be taken away by any one except themself. If there anyone reading this I want to thank u and wish you all the best. God bless America Charles R Johnstone&lt;/p&gt;" />
