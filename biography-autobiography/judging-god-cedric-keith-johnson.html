  <title>Judging God - Cedric Keith Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Judging is the cognitive process of reaching a decision or drawing conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our society we use judging to break the bounds of untruth that some use to control or lead astray, while many are left along because of no harm no foul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many will come to see that this book, entitled Judging God, is nothing more then, the process that one must use to judge the misconception that many use to control other more then themselves. While other would see a deeper meaning in this concept of Judging God, in that Judging God sets the process of freeing ones mind, to understand the harm in the concept itself, with the foul being we have all been lead astray. Judging God brings into play characters that has been left out, concepts that has been removed, in order to serve the few, to leave the massive in limbo. The conclusions is this, each person that reads this book understands that in life there are no conclusions we just give up the search. By judging God we as a human race un-judge ourselves to see each other as we are meant to be seen, clearly mask removed, no longer needing to confuse one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one person life journey of struggle and conflict with the authority of a God, that his follows has caused nothing but confusing and dismay, while in turn has left his believer in a state of denier, this denier has cause them to look away when faced with the possibility of their god being as incomplete as themselves. A small child once ask after suffering death of parent their has to be a God, because I have a lot of questions that needs to be answered. We all have questions that needs answering, judging God is the process of identifying his character in order to ask the right questions and getting the right answer. For far to long we have all been asking all the wrong people, all the right question, to only be turned away without our questions being fully answered. Follow me on this journey for I assure you wont be disappointed just imagine me as a driver on my way to liberation, I dont mind hitchhiker, some will not make it to the end, while some will enter an enlightenment witness like never before, and other will not even last a mile which one will you be?&lt;/p&gt;" />
