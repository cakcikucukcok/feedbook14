  <title>Going With God: Letters from Our Travels - Priscilla Flory</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Believing that prayer changes lives and situations, and believing that prayer is the most important service she can do for anyone, in 1989, author Priscilla Flory enlisted family and friends to join her in praying for widows and orphans around the world. In Going with God, she shares an endearing and heartfelt collection of personal letters penned to her faithful prayer partners. Spanning nearly three decades, the letters cover a variety of topics: some are whimsical and some are sobering. All of them are personal and all point to the loving heavenly Father who is the ultimate love of Flory&#39;s life. The letters follow Flory and her husband, Tom, as they traveled the world doing God&#39;s work for more than two decades. Going with God offers insight into Flory&#39;s journeys in Belarus, Peru, Rwanda, South Africa, and Swaziland. Her stories and illustrations show how God has powerfully and faithfully worked in her life." />
