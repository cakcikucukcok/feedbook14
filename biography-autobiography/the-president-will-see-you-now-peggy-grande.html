  <title>The President Will See You Now - Peggy Grande</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Peggy Grande&#39;s memoir is the book to read on Ronald Reagan&#39;s post-presidential years.... Among the most unique and touching [books] ever done on the man... Wonderful.&quot;--&lt;em&gt;The American&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Spectator&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; In &lt;i&gt;The President Will See You Now&lt;/i&gt;, devoted Reagan insider Peggy Grande shares behind-the-scenes stories, intimate moments, and insights into one of America&#39;s most beloved presidents. Grande, who started in the Office of Ronald Reagan as a college student and earned her way into a coveted role as the president&#39;s Executive Assistant, offers an unparalleled perspective on the post-presidency of a political icon. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Grande&#39;s stories and never-before-seen photos show a unique, private side to a public figure and leader who reshaped conservatism, ushered in an era of prosperity, and helped spur the end of the Cold War. Grande reveals what day-to-day life was like in Reagan&#39;s California office, including the former president&#39;s relationship with the First Lady and his interactions with friends, world leaders, and everyday Americans. Grande recalls how Reagan kept a vigorous schedule for years after he left the White House, his robust engagement with others, and ongoing political advocacy. Despite his eventual Alzheimer&#39;s diagnosis, Grande shows how Ronald Reagan remained true to core beliefs, his gentlemanly kindness, and his undying hope for his country. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today the Reagan legacy looms over American politics more than ever. Grande reminds readers why: When Ronald Reagan was president, we not only loved ourselves but also loved America, and the American values he represented: faith, optimism, and patriotism." />
