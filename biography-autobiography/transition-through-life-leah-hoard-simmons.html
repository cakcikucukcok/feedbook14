  <title>Transition Through Life - Leah Hoard-Simmons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a part of my assignment a part of God plan for me.
The Author was inspired by a prophetic word she received in November, 2010 to write about her life story that consist of a 10 year span. The prophetic word spoken was that I had come to some place of life that I am achieving some levels of happiness, but there is a piece of me that still feels victimize because I cant let my story be heard. But, I see a pen in your hand woman, you have been waiting on a very low scale, but God said that my autobiography is going to hit this nation and God said that he is going to provide opportunity for me and keep me alive along enough to be a delivery force for African American Women.
Transition Through Life (Embrace Your Today To See Your Tomorrow) is the Authors autobiography of multiple stages that she endured and experience on her life journey. Some were just by life circumstances and some were self afflicted. Yet through it all the Author learned perseverance, how to suffer long, compassion, obedience and trusting God through hardship, disappointment, betrayal, abandonment, shame and suffering which she endured.
Journey with the Author through her multiple and sometime repeated transitions she found 
 herself in as you read Transition Through Life (Embrace Your Today To See Your Tomorrow).
As you read the Authors story let it inspired you to break out and breakthrough, encourage you that you are not along and give you hope for any of your life transitions. But remember to embrace your today to see your tomorrow; knowing what you are going through is only a process and not a permanent address. And that deliverance has come and you have the Victory!" />
