  <title>Show Me the Way to Go Home - Shirley M. Odle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A carefree and idyllic childhood during the Depression allowed author Shirley Odle, born Shirley Cross, to become a free-spirited and self willed young lady. While growing up in Washington, she benefited from the hard work and perseverance of her loving parents. They provided a strong family life for her, her sister Margie, and her brother Bob. One day, a chance invitation to a church service from a fellow employee of her father, changed her family and reset the course of her life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this action packed memoir, she recounts her childhood experiences and teen years in loving detail. Introducing her college sweetheart Glen Odle, she recalls their shared experiences as he is drafted into the service during WWII. Marrying him in San Francisco, she follows him around the United States in exciting and challenging circumstances. Returning to the Pacific Northwest, Shirley continues her life story, sharing tales of her children and their growing up years. Through the years her belief in God remained, but Gods plans and Shirleys plans clashed, creating a life-long struggle. Guilt, forgiveness, and obedience spiral. God has been the centerpiece for her life, but sometimes the ups and downs of daily life baffled her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show Me the Way to Go Home is Shirley Odles honest and heartwarming story of her life and the role God has played in each step of the way.&lt;br /&gt;
