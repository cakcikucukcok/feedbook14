  <title>Legs of Iron - Albert A.C. Waite, Pauline Wiltshire</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Pauline Wiltshire&lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;i&gt;Mother, Author and Activist for the disabled in a wholesome society&lt;/i&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Retarded is how my first passport labelled me. Now it is disabled. &lt;i&gt;Which describes me more accurately?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;My hope is to help society to start to understand that I do not want them to apologise for my disability, or look away embarrassingly when I am around. I am who I am and will be the best I can. No pity. No bad treatment. No dehumanising. Is that too much to expect from an intelligent and civilised western society? Another of my dreams is that this book will help my son to ignore societys pressures and start to feel comfortable with his mother. Read on and tell me if I am expecting too much.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;b&gt;Dr Albert A.C. Waite&lt;/b&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The life sketches of Pauline Wiltshire is captured by this bio-author, who has focused his gaze to portray this powerful and moving story, armed with his own vivid experiences of life in rural Jamaica and metropolitan Britain.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Legs of iron is a biographical depiction of one womans fight for a fulfilling and independent life in the face of enormous obstacles. Her dream is for the reader to get a glimpse of one disabled persons mind, hopes, ambition, feelings and ability to love; then decidedly come to understand that the mind, not the external features, is a truer measure of the person.&lt;/p&gt;" />
