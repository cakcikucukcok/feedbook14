  <title>Exclusive! - Maurice Chittenden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On a hot, sunny day last August, the final newspaper still working from an office on London’s Fleet Street called ‘stop the press’ and closed its doors for the final time. Thirteen days later it was the turn of award-winning journalist Maurice Chittenden to make his excuses and leave.

One of the last surviving combatants in The Battle of Wapping, in which an attack on his car led to a police cavalry charge and a bloody riot, he is the most by-lined reporter in The &lt;i&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/i&gt; history with up to seven by-lines a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His career mirrored the rise and fall of Fleet Street and he freely admits that his own excesses played a part in its downfall. The Fleet Street he remembers with fondness no longer exists. But its reputation as the ‘Street of Shame’ survives in the name of the column in Private Eye which afforded him the plaudit of ‘the legendary Maurice Chittenden’ in its report of his professional demise.&lt;/p&gt;" />
