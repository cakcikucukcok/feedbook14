  <title>Hot Flashes and Southern Sasses - Kathleen Harper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Kathleen Harper is a southern gal who cant quit saying what she really thinks, calls things as she sees em, considers  herself a &quot;professional eavesdropper&quot;, and has the ability to find the humor in everyday life. In her second compilation of entertaining essays, Harper shares her twisted opinions on men, menopause, neighbors, and children from a unique Southern outlook. &quot;I&#39;m full of sass and vinegar...so just let me get started!&quot;
Harper, the author of &lt;i&gt;Why, Shut My Mouth!: Southern, Sassy and Proud of It,&lt;/i&gt; offers a laugh-out-loud look at life from a womans perspective that reminds us that life is as funny as we make it. Harpers humor is relevant to any woman who has experienced hot flashes so sizzling that she feels like a neon sign blinking on the side of the highway; has wondered why a search for her bikini body suddenly feels like a never-ending scavenger hunt; has shrieked, Gotta have &#39;em! while trying on the sexiest shoes ever and when asked by her Hubs &quot;Why did you call me a ___?&quot;, she remarks &quot;Google it why don&#39;t ya, and pick one!&quot;
In &lt;i&gt;Hot Flashes and Southern Sasses,&lt;/i&gt; Harper shares another sassy, opinionated, and truthful journey through the life of a middle-aged Southern gal that encourages women everywhere to laugh at themselves often and much, never take life too seriously, don&#39;t buy cheap wine or shoes, and have yourself a lifelong party! &quot;And if you decide to ever grow up...leave me out of it!&quot;
Harper is a native of the South Carolina and makes her home on the coastal and marsh regions. She is married, has 2 grown children, two remarkable grandsons and two well-behaved dogs! Life ain&#39;t bad, y&#39;all!" />
