  <title>Not Far From the Tree - Eric Otis Simmons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How does a child raised by a single-parent African American Mother go on to graduate in the &amp;ldquo;Top 10%&amp;rdquo; of his college class, walk-on and play college basketball, become President of his IBM sales training class, close sales of $1/2 million, $1 million, and $25 million in Paris, Brussels, and Hong Kong and self-publish a &amp;ldquo;&lt;b&gt;Best Seller&lt;/b&gt;&amp;rdquo; book?&amp;nbsp; Fueled by his Mom&amp;rsquo;s mantra, &amp;ldquo;You can do anything if you put your mind to it,&amp;rdquo; and other &amp;ldquo;seeds of knowledge&amp;rdquo; ingrained in him by her, Eric Otis Simmons went on to accomplish all of the above and more!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In &amp;ldquo;&lt;b&gt;Not Far From The Tree&lt;/b&gt;,&amp;rdquo; Simmons&amp;rsquo; Memoir, he shares his life story through a series of smaller stories that range from shocking to calamitous to sorrowful to triumphing.&amp;nbsp; Eric takes you through how he stumbled across a court document revealing his Dad&amp;rsquo;s surname was actually Bailey and how off guard that caught him.&amp;nbsp; He jokes about the time his Grandmother caught him and his cousin peeing out of a window, and they both lived.&amp;nbsp; Simmons also opens up about the tragic loss of his daughter and the frightening night his Mother was assaulted at gunpoint and his ensuing years-long anger.&amp;nbsp; You&amp;#39;ll walk down the hall with him through the secret tunnel underneath Alabama&amp;rsquo;s State Capitol where he meets Governor George Corley Wallace for the first time.&amp;nbsp; All he could think about was the Governor&amp;#39;s infamous words, &amp;ldquo;Segregation now, segregation forever!&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Eric&amp;#39;s insight into his remarkable career in Sales/Sales Management with Fortune 500 titans IBM, AT&amp;amp;T, GE, and MCI, reveals his strive for excellence centered around opening doors for other minorities.&amp;nbsp; Throughout his Memoir, Simmons masterfully ties together his Mother&amp;rsquo;s teachings with how he utilized them to overcome seemingly insurmountable odds to achieve academic, athletic, and business success in Corporate America.&lt;br /&gt;
