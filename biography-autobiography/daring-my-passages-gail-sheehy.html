      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The author of the classic &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller &lt;em&gt;Passages&lt;/em&gt; returns with her inspiring memoir&amp;#8212;a chronicle of her trials and triumphs as a groundbreaking &amp;#8220;girl&amp;#8221; journalist in the 1960s, to iconic guide for women and men seeking to have it all, to one of the premier political profilers of modern times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Candid, insightful, and powerful, &lt;em&gt;Daring: My Passages&lt;/em&gt; is the story of the unconventional life of a writer who dared . . . to walk New York City streets with hookers and pimps to expose violent prostitution; to march with civil rights protesters in Northern Ireland as British paratroopers opened fire; to seek out Egypt&amp;#8217;s president Anwar Sadat when he was targeted for death after making peace with Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always on the cutting edge of social issues, Gail Sheehy reveals the obstacles and opportunities encountered when she dared to blaze a trail in a &amp;#8220;man&amp;#8217;s world.&amp;#8221; &lt;em&gt;Daring&lt;/em&gt; is also a beguiling love story of Sheehy&amp;#8217;s tempestuous romance with and eventual happy marriage to Clay Felker, the charismatic creator of &lt;em&gt;New York&lt;/em&gt; magazine.

Bush, and the world-altering attraction between Margaret Thatcher and Mikhail Gorbachev.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sheehy reflects on desire, ambition, and wanting it all&amp;#8212;career, love, children, friends, social significance&amp;#8212;and lays bare her major life passages: false starts and surprise successes, the shock of failures and inner crises; betrayal in a first marriage; life as a single mother; flings of an ardent, liberated young woman; her adoption of a second daughter from a refugee camp; marriage to the love of her life and their ensuing years of happiness, even in the shadow of illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now stronger than ever, Sheehy speaks from hard-won experience to today&amp;#8217;s young women. Her fascinating, no-holds-barred story is a testament to guts, resilience, smarts, and daring, and offers a bold perspective on all of life&amp;#8217;s passages.&lt;/p&gt;" />
