  <title>I, Wabenzi - Rafi Zabor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Some time ago Rafi Zabor sat down to write a brief narrative of the year 1986. That was the year he set out across two continents in a used Mercedes--&quot;Wabenzi&quot; is the Swahili word for a member of the Mercedes-owning class--to buy a grave stone for his friend Mahmoud Rauf and to outrun the shadow of his own parents&#39; recent death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But like a boat against the current, the writer was drawn back into the past: his father&#39;s escape from the Nazis, Rafi&#39;s own Brooklyn boyhood surrounded by the fractious, Zabors and Zaborovskys, and the anguished--sometimes farcical--spiritual journey that led Zabor from Brooklyn to Turkey by way of Coltrane, the thirteenth-century mystic Muhyiddin Ibn &#39;Arabi, the McGovern campaign, Gurdjieff, a shoe salesman named Gogol, and the cataclysmic months Zabor spent studying (and whirling) amid a band of Sufis in rural England. The result--the first of a projected four volumes--is one of the most original, capacious, and vivid narratives of the last few decades, a real-life Bildungsroman dealing with an expanded range of human experience, from matters of life and death to a piece of what lies beyond them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Straight from the unchartered territory between &lt;i&gt;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Tristram Shandy&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;I, Wabenzi&lt;/i&gt; lifts a corner of the known world as if it were the edge of a curtain, and begins to show a reality new to our literature gleaming on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;" />
