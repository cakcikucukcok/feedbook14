  <title>The Rough Guide to Nelson Mandela - Max du Preez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Rough Guide to Nelson Mandela &lt;/i&gt;is a fresh, honest overview of the life story and the impact of one of the world&#39;s greatest modern icons. It assesses the influence of his rural, traditional childhood on his later personality, and his early years as a revolutionary leader and master strategist; including  his private life and troubled marriages. It explores his 27 years in an apartheid jail and reveals the inside stories of the white government&#39;s first secretive contacts with him and how he encouraged their intelligence chiefs to advise their political masters to abandon apartheid and negotiate a political settlement. &lt;i&gt;The Rough Guide to Nelson Mandela &lt;/i&gt;attempts to explain Mandela&#39;s remarkable lack of bitterness and his commitment to reconciliation with the white minority after his release. Readers get a rare insight into Mandela&#39;s role in during the crucial negotiations period and his term as South Africa&#39;s first black president. It critically examines his iconic status and impact on the world stage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Rough Guide to Nelson Mandela&lt;/i&gt; liberates Nelson Mandela from cloying myths and partisan portraits, pinpointing the true impact and legacy of one of the world&#39;s most recognizable figures.&lt;/p&gt;" />
