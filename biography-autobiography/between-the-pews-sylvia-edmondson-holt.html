  <title>Between the Pews - Sylvia Edmondson-Holt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is an invigorating story. The author tells about growing up peacefully in a small Southern community during the Civil Rights Movement. Her childhood was protected from much of the Jim Crow, racism, and unrest experienced in the segregated South during that time. Founded by former slaves and colored Civil War veterans, these landowners created a safe haven, a thriving village for its African American residents. This environment hardly prepared her for what life was like outside this protective shield that she had become accustomed to. 
She tells a moving, thrilling, and often touching story of how she dealt with life beyond this place. She exhibited great determination to rise above the many issues she faced while dealing with marriage, raising her children, and a struggle to grow up herself. Her children, being her most important spectators, watched as she tried to teach them by setting good examples." />
