      <meta name="description" content="Late November 1954, a young domestic helper with dreams of becoming the
best domestic helper she could
A young baker with a brand new bicycle, dreams and desire of becoming the
best sperm donor the district produced
They both met by coincidence and ever since the young baker swear his undying
love for her, It was a crush she knew nothing about. Then one fateful night,
destiny beckoned. After weeks of eyeing the young helper from afar, he got his
chance. She was on her way home from work when he rode up beside her and
offered to take her home. She refused his kind gesture. He wanted to be her
friend, but she was furious in rejecting him. His voice roared with anger, she
began trembling, and he couldnt imagine being rejected in such a manner and
held on to her. A fight ensued. With the powerful flow of his adrenalin, and the
mighty blow to his ego, he did the unthinkable. He overpowered her and had
his own way. She felt worthless and demeaned and cried in agony, but only the
stars above were in sympathy with her cry At first he was proud of his conquest,
but a guilty conscience began to prick his soul. He moved closer to the
crying young helper, with an intent of consoling her, but the wounded lioness
she was, she leapt at him with ferocious might and inflicted severe blows to his
head with a stone that she found at the side of the road
