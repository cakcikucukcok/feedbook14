  <title>The Living Past - Marlyna O. Sevilla</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a story about a girl in the Philippines who showed signs of autism until the age of five. Her name is Marlyna. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;bR&gt;
She was six years old when World War II broke out in 1941. In her life story, she takes us to evacuation places and to witness a Japanese soldier aim a shining bayonet at her pregnant aunt. Well walk with her in the darkness, treading on rocks among tall, thorny shrubs where footpaths ended. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;bR&gt;
She was twelve when her parents separated and was eventually separated from her siblings as well. Marlyna rejoiced as she was reunited with her mother and siblings in 1954. She vows not to be separated from them again. She migrated to Canada with husband and daughter in 1967, and endures the frigid cold and the pangs of loneliness. Nothing stands against her dream of bringing her mother and siblings to her new country.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;bR&gt;
Annie arrived first in 1969, the rest followed, and her ambition was realized when her mother arrived in 1974. Marlynas dream to be reunited with her family was no longer a dream but a reality. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;bR&gt;
Marlyna believes that education is freedom, the intangible asset that enriches ones life. She takes courses in business, writing, and public speaking under government assistance. Her Service Excellence Award in 1993 is her crowning achievement. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;bR&gt;
Now a Canadian snowbird in the Philippines since 2000, she works with community and church organizations. She enjoys sharing her knowledge gained from abroad with her own people.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;bR&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Living Past &lt;/i&gt;is a story of the life struggle and triumphs of a girl who once had only spoke five words. Marlyna believes that her experience with World War II, her broken home, and migration to the great country of Canada has made her a well-seasoned grandmother. Her first book a must-read!" />
