  <title>The Life of Akoa-Mongo Kara from Africa to the United States, Maine - François Kara Akoa-Mongo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is an excellent tool to learn how people used to live in Central Africa around 1960 when many African countries  started to become politically independent. One would learn how people lived, worked, socialized, traveled, took care of themselves when sick, the children and women contributing to the family economy, the system of education, family ties, territorial occupations, tribal relations, language formations, and settlements of the population..  He would also learn what happened from around 1954 concerning the struggles for independence, and the first leaders of African nations.  One would also learn about the difficulties of going to school, getting good health care, Black and White relations, and discrimination in reverse, difficulties of making a living, Christianity,  paganism, and poverty.
       Concerning the United States, one will learn about problems foreigners face in the United States in order to be acclimated, and acculturated, differences in culture, eating habits, weather, language, socialization, help for the poor, the role of church, education opportunities, humanitarian and Christian love, relations between Blacks from Africa, and African Americans, between Africans living in the States and those at home, problems between those living in the States,  problems of alienation of most children of the second generation of the immigrates.
        This book deals with men and women issues, Christian religion, paganism, and faith in God, the love of God, and serving others as a result of what God has done in someones life.
        This book is easy to read. It is good for those who would like to learn about African culture and people, the way others look at and see Americans; things to learn from each other as groups of people living in the same environment.
       Young people, families, churches, schools, anthropologists, sociologists, and political scientists may use this book.   These are wishes of the author,
Franois K. Akoa-Mongo" />
