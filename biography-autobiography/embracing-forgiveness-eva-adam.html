  <title>Embracing Forgiveness - Eva Adam</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Born and raised in Romania, Eva Adam, moved to Norway in 1993 and married her Norwegian husband, Leiv. Together with him and their son, Leif, Eva had the perfect family life, until the past managed to hunt her down. Going through a major shift, battling with her memories of sexual and physical abuse back in Romania, Evas body and mind started to break down, and she became sick and depressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motivated to learn how to change her health issue, Eva started to learn to heal herself practicing Reiki healing, shamanic healing, and meditation. She traveled to many places, attending many courses in Norway, Sweden, India, and the US, hoping one day shell feel better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But her healing started the day she started to forgive. Working with the teachings of A Course in Miracles helped Eva to close the gap of separation between her and God, between her and persons she believed did her wrong. She understood all she had to do in order to change her own life was to forgive all of them, including herself. Understanding that she could create or re-create her life every day, Eva managed to change her thoughts and break the circle of her ancestors. Guided by Gods words in her daily life, Eva finally changed her life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck to you.&lt;br /&gt;
I love you.&lt;br /&gt;
Be blessed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
