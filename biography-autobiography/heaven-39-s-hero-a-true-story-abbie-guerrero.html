      <meta name="description" content="&quot;In the initial impact, most of the helicopter&#39;s instruments and weight, which had been overhead, came loose and shifted to the right side of the helicopter. When the Augusta K2 hit the ground the second time, everything on that side- the transmission, the two jet engines and the main rotor head- shifted away from me and over to where Craig and Mario were seated. Everything on the right side of the helicopter was crushed from the impact and weight. Even though I was badly hurt and couldn&#39;t move, I had missed being crushed.&quot;   Abbie Guerrero was born in Santa Maria, California and is the oldest of four kids.
