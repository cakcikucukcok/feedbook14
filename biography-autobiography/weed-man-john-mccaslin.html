  <title>Weed Man - John McCaslin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration estimates that Americans in the&amp;nbsp;early 1970s were smoking upwards of 35,000 pounds of marijuana per day.&amp;nbsp;By the time the decade drew to a close, &lt;i&gt;Time&lt;/i&gt; magazine reported that reefer&amp;nbsp;had become “the most widely accepted illegal indulgence since drinking&amp;nbsp;during Prohibition.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can thank Jimmy Moree for helping to feed America’s insatiable pot&amp;nbsp;habit. Nicknamed “Jimmy Divine” for his teetotaling ways, he would become&amp;nbsp;one of the most successful marijuana traffickers of the 1970s, smuggling&amp;nbsp;high-grade South American weed across the tempestuous seas into North&amp;nbsp;American ports of call.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He was born and grew up poor in the Bahamas. That&amp;nbsp;life was forever changed on a morning jog when Jimmy literally stumbled&amp;nbsp;onto several million dollars’ worth of prime Colombian grass. He disposed of&amp;nbsp;the weed with a little help from a law-enforcement friend and was surprised&amp;nbsp;to earn over three hundred thousand dollars for his trouble. It was the first&amp;nbsp;deal of many. The money was easy, and the perks fantastic. Jimmy went on&amp;nbsp;to make?and give away?a fortune.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And now award-winning journalist John McCaslin is telling Jimmy’s&amp;nbsp;story. Several of the characters are identified by their actual names or by&amp;nbsp;nicknames. Identities of others have been changed to protect the guilty.&amp;nbsp;Rest assured, you’re in for a white-knuckle ride on the open seas where&amp;nbsp;adventure, enterprise, and entire fortunes go up in smoke.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“McCaslin brings his exceptional reportorial talent to bear in a&amp;nbsp;fascinating exposé of the drug trade.” —G. GORDON LIDDY&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Told in a breezy, witty style, McCaslin’s book captures moments&amp;nbsp;in relatively recent Caribbean history when it was . . . possible&amp;nbsp;to make a fortune by the ability to steer a boat stealthily through&amp;nbsp;dangerous seas.” —MARK BOWDEN&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Endorsements&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;I&#39;m delighted&amp;nbsp;to see&amp;nbsp;that John McCaslin has climbed out of his&amp;nbsp;political trench in Washington long enough to set sail on this&amp;nbsp;astonishing journey through&amp;nbsp;the precarious Caribbean reefs, and beyond.&amp;nbsp;Somehow,&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp; typical McCaslin&amp;nbsp;fashion, he manages to bring&amp;nbsp;his readers&amp;nbsp;back to&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;nation&#39;s capital&amp;nbsp;in a&amp;nbsp;chapter that&amp;nbsp;will certainly have&amp;nbsp;official tongues wagging in Washington.&quot;&amp;nbsp; -- Katie Couric, anchor and managing editor of the CBS Evening News and former&amp;nbsp;co-host of NBC&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Today&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;This story is so compelling . . .&amp;nbsp;John McCaslin has put it all together in a way that simply made me want to&amp;nbsp; just keep&amp;nbsp;on reading.
