The story includes their families, as they live after the American Revolution, during the Civil War, and when they move into the area now known as Little Switzerland, N. C. It is one that shows how people triumph over tragedy and the time in which they lived. Little Switzerland, founded in 1909, is a unique place in 2007. &quot;Downtown&quot; includes a post office, a store and cafe, with a connecting bookstore that has an eye-popping eclectic selection. It also has an historical inn with a walled cemetery attached. The cemetery speaks of the local people who live here now and were here before 1909. This book tells about some of their lives." />
