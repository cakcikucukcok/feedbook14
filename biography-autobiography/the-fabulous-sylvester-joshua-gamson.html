  <title>The Fabulous Sylvester - Joshua Gamson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A journey back through the music, madness, and unparalleled freedom of an era of change-the &#39;70s-as told through the life of ultra-fabulous superstar Sylvester&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Imagine a pied piper singing in a dazzling falsetto, wearing glittering sequins, and leading the young people of the nation to San Francisco and on to liberation where nothing was straight-laced or old-fashioned. And everyone, finally, was welcome-to come as themselves. This is not a fairy tale. This was real, mighty real, and disco sensation Sylvester was the piper. Joshua Gamson-a Yale-trained pop culture expert-uses him, a boy who would be fabulous, to lead us through the story of the &#39;70s when a new era of change liberated us from conformity and boredom. Gamson captures the exuberant life, feeling, energy, and fun of a generation&#39;s wonderful, magical waking up-from the parties to the dancing and music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story begins with a little black boy who started with nothing but  a really big voice. We follow him from the Gospel chorus to the glory days in the Castro where a generation shook off its shame as  Sylvester sang and began his rise as part of a now-notorious theatrical troup called the Cockettes. Celebrity, sociology, and music history mingle and merge around this endlessly entertaining story of a singer who embodied the freedom, spirit, and flamboyance of a golden moment in American culture.&lt;/p&gt;" />
