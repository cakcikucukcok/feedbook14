  <title>Timshall - Juliette Schlegl Fotsing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The title Timshall comes from a Hebrew word (Gen. 4:7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American writer John Steinbeck in his work entitled &lt;em&gt;East of Eden &lt;/em&gt;emphasizes this word as imperative. He writes that each individual by taking stock of his past raises one question was it good or was it bad? At the same time, with his interpretation thou mayest rule over sin, he opens a kind of divine desire in the mind of human beings. The translation of the Hebrew original verse is If you do well, will you not have honour? And if you do wrong, sin is waiting at the door, desiring to have you, but do not let it be your master. Born in Africa, more precisely in the west of Cameroon, the author was barely six months when she was separated from her mother due to a familial traditional confl ict. Her paternal grandmother who believed in Jesus Christ wanted her to grow up far away from her maternal family and their paganism. Was it a good thing? The author describes how until now even her professional life is completely a long scar on her body and mind. For this reason, she compares her career to the tool whose blade has a serrated shape and therefore subtitles this fi rst volume A saw-toothed Career. The author, Juliette Schlegl Fotsing, presents in an autobiographical novel her life full of objections, break, humiliation, bullying, barriers, and temptations that leads her like a river from her native home in Africa towards Germany, Sri Lanka, Ireland, and then London. She opens her work by offering us a trip in the colonial where her grandfather, son of a king of the Bamileke tribe, was enslaved and forced to labour work by colonists when he was just fi ve years old. She describes not only her youth in Africa in the context of such a very poor family and typically widened which colonialism has marked and modifi ed the quintessence even of their daily natural existence but always tells us how she deals with her life in terms of her search for stability since she arrived in Europe. The imperative may you is a golden rule of her novel. Some people acknowledge its value and use it wisely for the happiness of mankind without ever letting to mow like cows then compelled the slaughterhouse while others proudly take it as a healthy ingredient of destruction and extension of their Touch of Bad through intimidation, exploitation of their victims tirelessly for earnings crass and after their passing only gloomy and watery victims remain and die slowly in such of unspeakable hassle and starvation. The artwork design derives from a monument called Woman Water Carrier located at Rostock Zoo in Germany that shows a West African woman symbolising the river of life, the joy and gladness for the entire world. She has the power to tackle any diffi culties by struggling daily in body and soul for the survival of the family and bringing them life even though she is isolated from the rest of the world. For many Europeans and others Woman Water Carrier is defi nitely the symbol for the strength and the head of her community and those agree that without her Africa has no hope. The unknown woman whose word Timshel has always captured her attention is just trying in her own way to refresh our thoughts while taking decisions and judgement through her life in Africa, Europe, and here among us . . .The main title of the artwork and Woman Water Carrier is designed by Juliette Schlegl Fotsing.&lt;/p&gt;" />
