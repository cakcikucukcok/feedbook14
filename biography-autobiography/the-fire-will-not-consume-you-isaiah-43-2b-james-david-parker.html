  <title>The Fire Will Not Consume You—Isaiah 43:2B - James David Parker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Author James David Parkers once thriving professional career was in a nosedive to disaster. His once-profitable investments dragged him to the precipice of financial ruin. The stress of the battle for survival wasted his will. Mental depression trashed his intellect. As a nominal, but skeptical, Christian, he asked: Can Jesus rescue me? Will Jesus deliver me from my earthly hell? And thus began his journeya search for truth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In The Fire Will Not Consume YouIsaiah 43:2b, Parker shares his progression from successful engineer to cynicism, to financial disaster and stress-induced illness, to the spirit-led process of prayer and recovery, and finally, to acknowledgement of his intimate relationship with his creator God. Each chapter in the core of the book begins with a prayer addressing a specific deficit in character or perception. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fire Will Not Consume YouIsaiah 43:2b chronicles Parkers recovery from mental depression through introspective prayer and Bible study. He offers a guidebook to unleash the unlimited power of God to bring personal peace in prayerful communication with him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
