  <title>Is It Me? Or Is It the Wine? Confessions of a 30 Yr Old SWF - Kate C. Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I am 30 years old, still single, following a dream, wallowing in self pity; yet I manage to briefly mask my self-loathing with wine, random flings with B list celebrities, professional athletes, dating men that are full blown sociopaths, and basically being a well known socialite.    Unlike most relationship/non-fiction books about random people&#39;s lives, I am the voice of every 30-something woman, who just hasn&#39;t quite figured it out yet. This is about finding love, losing love, finding yourself, losing yourself, eating Taco Bell until you feel like you are going to die, and remembering regret overrides fear.   Everyone has a story, I just have the balls to tell mine. This is my life, raw and unedited." />
