  <title>Is America Falling Apart? - Mahnaz B. Consolver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Before Mahnaz Consolver came to the United States, she held some positive preconceived notions about the people and the lifestyles in the country. But what she found surprised her. In this memoir, Consolver shares her impressions, framed by her experiences as an immigrant, and provides ideas and solutions to maintain the United States status as the land of opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Is America Falling Apart?&lt;/i&gt;, Mahnaz discloses a wealth of observations and concludes with a list of lessons shes learned while living in the United States. From the moment she departed the airplane and entered the airport, Mahnazs life became a series of new and different experiences. She comments on everything American, including bathrooms, drug use, homelessness, media, television, video games, driving, wastefulness, sports, and even dogs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through these observations, experienced by someone new to the country, Mahnaz hopes to wake up the American public and encourage them to get involved to solve the problems that
threaten this land of glory.&lt;/p&gt;" />
