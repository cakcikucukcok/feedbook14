  <title>Grace and Peace - Dr. Deb Hedderly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; &quot; Dr. Deb Hedderly offers the reader a glimpse into her personal journey as she encounters life&#39;s obstacles. Her deep spirituality helps her to meet each challenge with courage and grace. When life hands you lemons, pick up this book to find insight and comfort between its pages.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Dr. Laura Hyatt, Professor and Chair, Doctoral Program in Organizational Leadership, University of La Verne&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &quot;Dr. Deb Hedderly asks honest questions that helped her during an unexpected series of events in her life&#39;s journey. Courage to ask ourselves the right questions may be the authentic salve needed when life deals us unwelcomed wounds. Join Dr. Hedderly as she walks us through her journey to inner peace. I believe personal discoveries that lead to hope and health may be found in the pages of this story of her walk of faith.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Dr. Heidi Scott, PhD., Learning Pursuits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &quot;Dr. Deb Hedderly openly shares her personal tragedies and difficult relationships to show others how she is finding peace and contentment through it all. She finds her strength and courage through God&#39;s word that she eloquently quotes as we follow her unwavering path toward healing.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
