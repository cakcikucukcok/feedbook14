  <title>Fat Girl Walking - Brittany Gibbons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Told through a series of larger-than-life snapshots, a hilarious memoir in essays about love, sex, marriage, motherhood, bikinis, and loving your body, no matter what size you are from the acclaimed blogger and body image advocate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brittany Gibbons has been a plus size her whole life. But instead of hiding herself in the shadows of thinner women, Brittany became a wildly popular blogger and national spokesmodel&amp;#8212;known for stripping on stage at TedX and standing in Times Square in a bikini on national television, and making skinny people everywhere uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talking honestly about size and body image on her popular blog, brittanyherself.com, she has ignited a national conversation. Now in her first book, she shares hilarious and painfully true stories about her life as a weird overweight girl growing up in rural Ohio, struggling with dating and relationships, giving the middle finger to dieting, finding love with a man smaller than her, accidentally having three kids, and figuring out the secret to loving her curves and becoming a nationally recognized body image advocate. And there&amp;#8217;s sex, lots of it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fat Girl Walking&lt;/em&gt; isn&amp;#8217;t a diet book. It isn&amp;#8217;t one of those former fat people memoirs about how someone battled, and won, in the fight against fat. Brittany doesn&amp;#8217;t lose all the weight and reveal the happy, skinny girl that&amp;#8217;s been hiding inside her. Instead, she reminds us that being chubby doesn&amp;#8217;t mean you&amp;#8217;ll end up alone, unhappy, or the subject of a cable medical show. What&amp;#8217;s important is learning to love your shape. With her infectious humor and soul-baring honesty, &lt;em&gt;Fat Girl Walking&lt;/em&gt; reveals a life full of the same heartbreak, joy, oddity, awkwardness, and wonder as anyone else&amp;#8217;s. Just with better snacks.&lt;/p&gt;" />
