  <title>Robert Louis Stevenson: A Record, an Estimate, and a Memorial - Alexander H. Japp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;WITH HITHERTO UNPUBLISHED LETTERS FROM R. L. STEVENSON IN FACSIMILIE . . .&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
PREFACE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A few words may here be allowed me to explain one or two points. &amp;nbsp;First, about the facsimile of last page of Preface to Familiar Studies of Men and Books. &amp;nbsp;Stevenson was in Davos when the greater portion of that work went through the press. &amp;nbsp;He felt so much the disadvantage of being there in the circumstances (both himself and his wife ill) that he begged me to read the proofs of the Preface for him. &amp;nbsp;This illness has record in the letter from him (pp. 28-29). &amp;nbsp;The printers, of course, had directions to send the copy and proofs of the Preface to me. &amp;nbsp;Hence I am able now to give this facsimile.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With regard to the letter at p. 19, of which facsimile is also given, what Stevenson there meant is not the &amp;ldquo;three last&amp;rdquo; of that batch, but the three last sent to me before&amp;mdash;though that was an error on his part&amp;mdash;he only then sent two chapters, making the &amp;ldquo;eleven chapters now&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;sent to me by post.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another point on which I might have dwelt and illustrated by many instances is this, that though Stevenson was fond of hob-nobbing with all sorts and conditions of men, this desire of wide contact and intercourse has little show in his novels&amp;mdash;the ordinary fibre of commonplace human beings not receiving much celebration from him there; another case in which his private bent and sympathies received little illustration in his novels. &amp;nbsp;But the fact lies implicit in much I have written.&lt;br /&gt;
