      <meta name="description" content="Dr. Ohmart was born in McPherson, Kansas, May 29, 1936. After completing high school Dick enrolled in the University of Kansas and received a bachelors degree. During his senior year at KU he married his high school sweetheart, Carol Socolofsky.
In the fall of 1958 Dick entered medical school, also at the University of Kansas, graduating in June 1962. Dick and Carol, now having two boys, Dale and Dean, interned in Wichita then moved to Oakley, Kansas. Susan, their third child, was born in Oakley. Dr. Ohmart practiced in Oakley until his retirement in 2001.
Dr. Ohmart was elected to Alpha Omega Alpha, the medical honorary society. He was chosen Rural Practitioner of the Year in 1999 by the National Rural Health Association. In 2000 the Kansas Academy of Practice selected Dr. Ohmart as Family Physician of the Year.
Dr. Ohmart fell on the ice in January 2001, sustaining a subdural hematoma. Surgery to remove the hematoma was followed by a stroke. After spending six months in a Denver hospital, Carol took him to an apartment in Denver. Along with Carol, he continues his recovery spending the warmer months in Oakley and the winter months in Texas." />
