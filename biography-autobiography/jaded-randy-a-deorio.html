  <title>Jaded - Randy A. Deorio</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a true story of a woman whose eccentric and bohemian existence led her down a path of abuse and exploitation, by not only the men in her life whom she loved and adored, but the bureaucratic system that she trusted and depended on for justice.
   Its about the loss of her life with her children, to the creation of a new life with another and her fight to keep it. Was it fate, destiny or karma that caused all of the events that took place, or was it just a series of bad choices that she made in her life? Perhaps it was a combination of everything from her family to the environment she was exposed to at an early age.
   Her story is told by her cousin, Randy, whose fascination with Alishas history has led him to the writing of this provocative biography.
   Some of the names have been changed to protect the innocent." />
