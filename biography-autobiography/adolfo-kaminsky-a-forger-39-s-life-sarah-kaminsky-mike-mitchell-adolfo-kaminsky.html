Recruited as a young Jewish teenager for his knowledge of dyes, Kaminsky became the primary forger for the French Resistance during the Nazi occupation of Paris. Then, as a professional photographer, Kaminsky spent the next twenty-five years clandestinely producing thousands of counterfeit documents for immigrants, exiles, underground political operatives, and pacifists across the globe. Kaminsky kept his past cloaked in secrecy well into his eighties, until his daughter convinced him to share the details of the life-threatening work he did on behalf of people fighting for justice and peace throughout the world.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;It took me two years of research and some twenty interviews before I got to know Adolfo Kaminsky, who I only knew as &#39;Papa&#39;: decoding his silences, detecting between the notes of his monotone delivery things he didn&#39;t put into words, understanding the parables and finding the messages hidden beneath the series of anecdotes that filled my notebook. And sometimes I needed to see the way other people looked at him to understand his choices, his life as a forger, his work underground, his political commitments, his inability to understand society and the hatred motivating various groups that encumbered it, his desire to build a world of justice and freedom.&quot; &amp;#151;Sarah Kaminsky, Prologue&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
