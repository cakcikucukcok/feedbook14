  <title>Shattered Dreams - Phil Spencer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is a war that goes on inside each and every one of us who struggles with alcohol or drugs. The battlefield is our soul and minds; moreover, when it kicks into full gear, it destroys what ever it comes in contact with. It is not a respecter of persons, nor does it care what your stature in life is. That war will drag you down to the pits of hell, and the sad reality is that you may not know it until the very end. It will take your wife and children, your job and home; it will put you under a bridge or sleeping on a heating grate with no food for days on end. But those are not the worst things that can happen to you. Your internal war will make you feel lost and alone, taking every shred of self-respect until there is nothing left inside except contempt for your very existence. There will be an emptiness unlike anything you have ever known, and the will to live will be taken from you. But there is hope and, you can have victory over that which wants to kill you. This book has the answers you seek." />
