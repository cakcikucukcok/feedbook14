      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The compelling autobiography of a remarkable Catholic woman, sainted by many, who championed the rights of the poor in America’s inner cities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Dorothy Day died in 1980, the New York Times eulogized her as &amp;#8220a nonviolent social radical of luminous personality . . . founder of the Catholic Worker Movement and leader for more than fifty years in numerous battles of social justice.&amp;#8221 Here, in her own words, this remarkable woman tells of her early life as a young journalist in the crucible of Greenwich Village political and literary thought in the 1920s, and of her momentous conversion to Catholicism that meant the end of a Bohemian lifestyle and common-law marriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Long Loneliness chronilces Dorothy Day’s lifelong association with Peter Maurin and the genesis of the Catholic Worker Movement.
