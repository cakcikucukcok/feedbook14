  <title>Life in a Marital Institution - James Braly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;LIFE IN A MARITAL INSTITUTION is a look inside the manic marriage of opposites, from the winning point of view of the husband, the &quot;gaspingly funny&quot; (&lt;i&gt;Variety&lt;/i&gt;), &quot;never less than excellent&quot; (&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;) writer of the hit Off-Broadway show of the same name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The marriage memoir--from Elizabeth Gilbert&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Committed&lt;/i&gt; to Isabel Gillies&#39;s &lt;i&gt;It Happens Every Day &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;--&lt;/i&gt;has been a balm to beleaguered wives everywhere.  But who speaks for the husbands--and tells you what you never get to hear from your girlfriends?  In this sharp, funny, poignant glimpse into a very unusual marriage, sensitive, decent, shell-shocked James Braly earns the job.  His marriage to a woman who is so &lt;i&gt;bewitching--&lt;/i&gt;that at their very first meeting she corrects the handwriting he uses to write her prized name and number on a slip of paper--is by turns fascinating and casually shocking. Thus begins a romance that includes progressive adventures in extended breastfeeding, co-sleeping, even fine dining (dinner parties whose guests include a connoisseur of human placenta: &quot;pan roasted...in cumin&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scenes from Braly&#39;s marriage are wrapped around the story that explains why someone chooses such a partnership to begin with: a colorful, kooky family that includes a fierce bomber pilot dad, a debutante heiress mom, and a delightfully druggy sister dying in a Houston hospice, and who&#39;d rather be dead than married to James&#39;s wife. In other words, love is what love was--only darkly hilarious.&lt;br&gt;Braly&#39;s one-man show of the same name is currently touring the country, produced by Meredith Vieira Productions, which is developing the show for television.&lt;/p&gt;" />
