  <title>My Incredible Journey - Dianand Denny Bhagwandin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I came from a poor family, but was afforded all the opportunities to make myself a better person than my parents, who did not have those opportunities. My childhood days were hard living on a farm, getting up early in the morning, doing my chores and then walking two miles to school. &lt;br /&gt;My high school days was not as good as expected and I put that to the conditions under which I had to deal with, living away from home, sometimes under unpleasant situations, and then getting up at 5:00 am to travel by train to Georgetown to get to school. I remember reading that Abraham Lincoln had to walk six miles per day to go to school, and he became one of the best President of the United States of America. &lt;br /&gt;My studies were cut short to assist my family when they were faced with major problems. I realized that the experience I gained by joining the SSU made me a better person. As I began my life anew I was determined to be successful in whatever my endeavors were. &lt;br /&gt;Success comes with hard work and perseverance and I took advantage of all the windows of opportunities that came my way, like forming Patrician Phone Corporation and South Jamaica Services, and running for Congress. &lt;br /&gt;To the readers of my autobiography, especially the younger generation, I want to tell you that the sky is not the limit. There are many opportunities out there, you have to take the time to look for what interests you. &lt;br /&gt;If I had to live my life over again, I would probably do the same things all over again, but I think with less mistakes. I have no regrets because I did it my all way.&lt;/p&gt;" />
