  <title>From Grief to Glory - Otto Rieke Ii</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Cataclysmic events, some representing lifes most grievous tragedies, have struck Otto Rieke&#39;s family. Tragedy and grief, viewed retrospectively, have rendered the subsequent glory of life all the more glorious. Life would have been unlivable, and this book unreadable, were they a mere cosmic pity party. After enduring a full circle along the rim of hell on Earth; and having survived almost in tact, hopefully this book will portray the Riekes&#39; ascension to the glory that has been most of the familys, and Otto&#39;s own precarious existence on planet Earth. The author&#39;s essentially privileged, fulfilling, and competitive existence (prior to the anguishing events of mid-life), are narrated fully from birth with a comedic flair, and did prepare him for the survival of the really tough stuff. The Rieke&#39;s did not just endure it all, but have thrived, and have ascended time and again. Life continues as a search for the ultimate Truth, and for the Glory that is only Gods to possess completely. The family lives to seek its share of that glory. &lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;It is Otto&#39;s hope that this book is fun and non-controversial. He has attempted to accomplish that by staying on topics about which he claims expertise: politics, religion, and sex. &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;If anything he says offends you, then you need to, either: &lt;br&gt;
   1. Repent, OR,&lt;br&gt;
   2. Sue him &lt;br&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;He apologizes only to those who were not offended, but who should have been. The author further hopes that you take the slight as it was intended, and hurt all the more. However, seriously, it is also hoped that this book is as entertaining as the exuberant feeling that its writing experience has given Otto. &lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;Family is who the Rieke&#39;s are. Family is the root of our society, and the family home is the first and most important school that our children will forever attend. Our parents are the first and the most important teachers that our children will forever have. Otto&#39;s stunning, wonderful wife of an earlier twenty five years, and of such unpretentious beauty, Mary Beth, and Otto raised five absolutely beautiful children, all of whom have encountered life very successfully. They are successful most of all by being good and loving people, as well as in all their spiritual, academic, athletic, personal, and professional endeavors. All of the Rieke children graduated from St Peters Catholic grade school, and local high schools, Rockhurst, St Teresas, and Notre Dame de Sion, all of which are in Kansas City, Mo. They and their spouses subsequently have graduated from various universities, including Rockhurst University, Central Missouri State University, Tulsa University, Syracuse University School of Journalism, Missouri University Medical School, St Louis University, The Medical School of Washington University in St Louis, Dartmouth College Medical School, and finally a post residency Fellow at the Harvard School of Medicine. The Rieke children, including their respective spouses are blessed beyond what would seem possible all in one family. &lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;The calamities referred to above, and subsequent grief, have chronologically seemed to coincide with - and maybe have been the genesis of, a subsequently inspired inner spiritual strength - indeed an almost supernatural strength to survive. Persistent strings of well earned successes at all personal levels of character, and by all worldly measure, might well be rooted in the strength of the Riekes&#39; souls to survive. The family members have ascended to new lives with the strength to carry on, to love, and indeed to thrive. That, and the authors love relationships with them all, is the grandeur, the glory, of this book. &lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;No names have been changed to protect the innocent; there are none. &lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;Otto has an unparalleled flair to entertain, and to tell riveting stories with great passion. He will seize your very soul. If you can remain calmly seated while reading this book, then it is a failure. Get ready for the ride. &lt;/p&gt;" />
