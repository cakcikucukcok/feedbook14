  <title>The Far Pavilions - M. M. Kaye</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This sweeping epic set in 19th-century India begins in the foothills of  the towering Himalayas and follows a young Indian-born orphan as he&#39;s  raised in England and later returns to India where he falls in love with  an Indian princess and struggles with cultural divides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Far Pavilions &lt;/i&gt;is  itself a Himalayan achievement, a book we hate to see come to an end.  It is a passionate, triumphant story that excites us, fills us with joy,  move us to tears, satisfies us deeply, and helps us remember just what  it is we want most from a novel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;M.M. Kaye&#39;s masterwork  is a vast, rich and vibrant tapestry of love and  war that ranks with  the greatest panoramic sagas of modern fiction, moving the famed  literary critic Edmond Fuller  to write: &quot;Were Miss Kaye to produce no  other book, &lt;i&gt;The Far Pavilions &lt;/i&gt;might stand as a lasting accomplishment in a single work comparable to Margaret Mitchell&#39;s achievement in &lt;i&gt;Gone With the Wind&lt;/i&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
