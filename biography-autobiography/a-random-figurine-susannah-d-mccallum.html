  <title>A Random Figurine - Susannah D. McCallum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Ive written this book for two reasons; first because my story is different and I thought it would be of interest to my readers, and second, as a therapeutic tool for myself, recollecting memories of my past and the significance each event has had for me in coming to terms with my story.&lt;br&gt;
The books first three chapters describes my relationship with the three women who represented a mother figure to me and my unending need to find my birth mother and my roots. &lt;br&gt;
As I eventually find her, my true sentiments  for her are described as well as those for my two also found brothers. &lt;br&gt;
I describe one of my most intense sentiments, how Ive always had an urge for my homeland, unable ever to adjust to a different territory, as well as the memories from my early years as I visit my country again and how they impact my inner self. &lt;br&gt;
I bring to light the unfairness to the adopted in not allowing them the right to know who they are, a primary need for most, which is a basic human right and how the truth, even when painful, should always prevail. &lt;br&gt;
I talk about four primary feelings that have been my constant companions and try to understand them. &lt;br&gt;
Later, traveling through different countries a month after finding my roots enabled me to look at my persona not as a different unique one but as just part of all humanity and allowed me to be more understanding as to my place with its respect. &lt;br&gt;
In the end, more hidden feelings arise and I am able to accept them as such. &lt;br&gt;
It has been therapeutic as well as more self-assuring to my nature as the dark passages in my life and the endurance I developed resolves most of  my internal conflicts. &lt;br&gt;
I timidly engaged into writing and without prior expertise have written each word as it flew directly from my heart and although I do accept my imperfections, I am grateful for this experience, a sanctuary for me, a tool and an inspiration for those with similar challenges and an informant for those without them. &lt;br&gt;
