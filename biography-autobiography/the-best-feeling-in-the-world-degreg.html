  <title>The Best Feeling In The World - DeGreg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Full of nostalgia and heart, DeGreg takes us on a very personal journey of coming of age in the tumultuous times of the Sixties and Seventies. Think of a completely honest version of &lt;em&gt;The Wonder Years &lt;/em&gt;filled with rock &amp;lsquo;n roll, basketball, sex, and lots of easily forgotten truths about growing up.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&lt;strong&gt;Ace Atkins&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; Bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Redeemers&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;ldquo;Had Holden Caulfield grown up in Rutherford, New Jersey, he might have found the Mountain Way Gang and The Best Feeling in the World. DeGreg&amp;rsquo;s coming-of-age memoir is a reminder of the pitfalls, pratfalls, and endless adventure that&amp;rsquo;s possible right out the front door to an American kid.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;ndash;&amp;ndash; &lt;strong&gt;Mark Strassmann&lt;/strong&gt;, CBS News&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;ldquo;[DeGreg has] a style of writing that is verbally alive&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;leaping language...makes reading fun.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;ndash;&amp;ndash; &lt;strong&gt;William Davies King&lt;/strong&gt;, author, &lt;em&gt;Collections of Nothing&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; From &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Best Feeling In The World&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s funny how you come around to learn things, like sometimes you get exactly what you wanted, but it turns out to be the last thing you needed.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; This is the story of a boy named Dego, written by a man called DeGreg; the story of a classic middle class middle child&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;a baby, then a boy, trying hard to become a man, and f-ing it up along the way. Growing up across the river from New York City has a certain affect on a Jersey boy; though we have no idea what that might be. The fun of it is, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter where you grew up, you&amp;rsquo;ll see yourself in these stories. You&amp;rsquo;ll be running through the neighborhood right alongside the kids of the Mountain Way Gang&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;playing army, baseball, kick-the-can, or whatever else kids dream up when searching for fun, killing time, or chasing after... The Best Feeling In The World.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; And, what a world it turns out to be, a freaky mess of good and evil, and a whole lot of middle ground. A kaleidoscope of life bombarding the senses, tempting us, scaring us, inspiring us forward. Even the best childhood doesn&amp;rsquo;t last forever and none truly prepares any of us for what might happen next. Sometimes, things get a little hairy. Grade school innocence fades and crazy sexy heartbreaking adolescence rises up.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;ldquo;I looked at the two-family houses next to us, I wondered if the people who lived there, in those exact houses, knew about this, about intercourse. Did everybody know, except me?&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s a crazy world, crazier still inside the mind of fifteen-year-old having a tough time of it. It&amp;rsquo;s funny how one wrong move can really mess things up, even change a person forever. Chances are Dego&amp;rsquo;s journey is a lot like yours, and altogether different at the same time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; We&amp;rsquo;re all chasing after it, whatever it is. It&amp;rsquo;s not the same for everyone, and it might change over time. No matter what it is, you know it when you feel it, it&amp;rsquo;s... &lt;strong&gt;The Best Feeling In The World&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Get the book. Read it now. The teenager in you will appreciate it, even if you end up flipping yourself off in the process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
