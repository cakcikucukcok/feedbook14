  <title>By the Time You Read This - Giles Blunt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Detective John Cardinal is on the hunt for an ingenious killer even as he mourns his own wife&#39;s tragic death in this thriller of heart-stopping suspense&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autumn has arrived in Algonquin Bay, and with it an unusual spate of suicides. The most shocking victim yet is Detective John Cardinal&#39;s wife, who has finally succumbed to her battle with manic depression. As Cardinal takes time to grieve, his partner, Lise Delorme, handles an unsavory assignment: a young girl appears in a series of unspeakable photos being traded online, and background elements indicate she lives in Algonquin Bay. Delorme is desperate to find the girl before she suffers more abuse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Cardinal receives a string of hateful anonymous notes about his wife&#39;s death, he begins to suspect homicide. His colleagues believe he is too distraught to think clearly, and he&#39;s forced to investigate alone. In doing so, he comes up against a brand of killer neither he--nor the reader--has ever seen before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his most masterful and thrilling novel yet, Giles Blunt confirms his reputation as a rising international star in crime fiction, and positions Detective John Cardinal among the finest characters in the genre.&lt;/p&gt;" />
