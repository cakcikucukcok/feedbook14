When the body of a newborn child is found in one of their tanning pits, Cragg&#39;s inquiry falls foul of a cabal of merchants dead set on modernizing the town&#39;s economy and regarding the despised tanners--and Cragg&#39;s apparent championship of them--as obstacles to their plan. The murder of a baby is just the evidence they need to get rid of the tanners once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the inquest into the baby&#39;s death is disrupted when the inn where it is being held mysteriously burns down, and Cragg himself faces a charge of lewdness, jeopardizing his whole future as a coroner. But the fates have not finished playing with him just yet. The sudden and suspicious death of a very prominent person may just, with the help of Fidelis&#39;s sharp forensic skills, bring about Cragg&#39;s redemption...&lt;/p&gt;" />
