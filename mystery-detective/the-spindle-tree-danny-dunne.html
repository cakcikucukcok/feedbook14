  <title>The Spindle Tree - Danny Dunne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Atmospheric Irish suspense novel capturing a nostalgic era in Irish culture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Sarah knows what happened to the Larkin children. They were spirited away somewhere because their father had abandoned them when their mother died. Her own mother too is very ill. What will happen if she dies when her father is away working in England? But then, her mother dies suddenly and there is no sign of her father returning. She has to take drastic measures, and hide her body to pretend to the world that nothing has happened. Life on the outside must go on as normal. When her Dad comes home, he&amp;rsquo;ll know what to do. But as the days wear on, there is no sign of him. Meanwhile, she and her brothers are led into a maze of events outside their control, which will draw them back many years later to confront their past. What will they find there? Will the whole house of cards come crashing down on them, or will they find redemption?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a tragic but gripping Irish story about a young family struggling to cope after losing a parent. With their mother gone and not knowing where their father is, they risk everything to keep their tight family together when everything seems to be working against them. Suddenly they find themselves taking on roles and facing challenges they never wanted to experience, all the while pretending to be normal while living a lie! Worried they will become orphans and separated from each other like the Larkin children, this really is a poignant story of a lost childhood and redemption.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
