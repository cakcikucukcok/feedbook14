She, her new boyfriend, and her two children are taking a trip&amp;#8212;leaving their home on Sandling Island, off the coast of England, for a dream vacation. As soon as her fifteen-year-old daughter, Charlie, returns from a sleepover, they can get ready to leave. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Charlie doesn&amp;#8217;t come home at the expected time. Nina can&amp;#8217;t believe of all days, Charlie has chosen this day to be late. As minutes and then hours tick by, Nina&amp;#8217;s annoyance soon changes to concern, and then to a chilling certainty that something terrible has happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The police insist there&amp;#8217;s no reason to worry&amp;#8212;yet. Teenagers are unreliable, impulsive. Nina always thought she and Charlie had a solid, trusting relationship, but seeking out Charlie&amp;#8217;s friends for clues to her whereabouts makes her reconsider. How well does Nina know her daughter, really? How well can a parent ever know a child? And will everything Nina &lt;em&gt;doesn&amp;#8217;t&lt;/em&gt; know&amp;#8212;about Charlie, her neighbors, even the friends and family closest to them&amp;#8212;prove fatal&amp;#8230;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Losing You&lt;/em&gt; once again proves that Nicci French is at the height of their storytelling powers in a clever, mind-bending thriller that has readers guessing at every twist and turn.&lt;/p&gt;" />
