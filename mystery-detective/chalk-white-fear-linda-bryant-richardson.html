  <title>Chalk White Fear - Linda Bryant Richardson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="CHALK WHITE FEAR tells the story of a child who was kidnapped and raised by a serial killer.  It tells of the strengths this highly intelligent child pulled from within to form the survival mechanisms that kept her alive throughout her childhood.
Some background on the book:
Many years ago, a band of easily led misfits made their way to an uninhabited area in the Southern United States.  Their leader possessed a cold cruel heart and mystical powers.  She planted a small tree and chanted until the tree and twenty foot around it became cursed with powers that only she understood.  After the queens death, the band of misfits gradually either died or moved away.  Only one couple stayed, built a home and attempted to lead a normal life.  The years passed.
In a modern day setting, a young couple settles on that same land.  They are not bothered by the strange things that happen in and around the home.  Later one of these characters kidnaps a toddler and brings the child back home as a companion to her daughter.
The years passed and the tree became magnificent and spellbinding.  The child was not easily influenced by the cursed tree, nor was she aware of the curses frustrated constant attempts to capture and kill her.  It was all she could manage not to anger the woman she called mother.
The question is:  Will the child survive?
