  <title>Ludwig&#39;s Fugue - Courtney Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Can David Ludwig Emerge from His Fugue?&lt;br /&gt;
Was He Set Up &amp;hellip; or Did He Murder His Family?&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
The Wet Mountain Valley Sheriff&amp;rsquo;s Office has its hands full when they must not only deal with solving a homicide, but, with limited resources, must call in the CBI and deal with an arrogant and closed-minded agent.&lt;br /&gt;
White Feather, an old Cherokee medicine man, uses his unique skills to compete with the local Sheriff&amp;#39;s Office to solve mysteries. He sometimes compliments but more often complicates the more traditional investigating methods of local law enforcement.&lt;br /&gt;
Sam Morrison, fired from the Denver Police Homicide Division, accepts a job in the beautiful Wet Mountain Valley Sheriff&amp;#39;s Office just in time to work on the Ludwig murders. Can he solve the crime?&amp;nbsp; Will his personal life that caused his ex-wife to flee from him complicate his ability to work?&amp;nbsp; And, will Sam be able to put his life and his family back together again?&lt;br /&gt;
Set in the scenic, rural Wet Mountain Valley of southern Colorado, the White Feather Mysteries are a delightful cross between &amp;ldquo;Cozy Mystery&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Geezer Lit&amp;rdquo;.&amp;nbsp; Multiple book award-winning author Courtney Miller will keep you guessing until the end!&lt;br /&gt;
