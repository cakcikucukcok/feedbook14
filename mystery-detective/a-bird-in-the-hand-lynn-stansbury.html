  <title>A Bird in the Hand - Lynn Stansbury</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The body of a young woman is found in a dump in American Samoa. Then the prime suspect in her death is found half-eaten by sharks. Natural justice? Native justice? Or something else entirely? Lieutenant Han, a Korean-American homicide detective on loan to this remote South Pacific island nation, is also its only trained investigator. Born in one culture, raised in another, married into a third and now working in a fourth, Han takes nothing for granted about why people kill each other. Even so, these two deaths make no sense.&lt;/P&gt;
Meanwhile, Han&#39;s estranged Japanese wife is back in Samoa, apparently more interested in an American ecologist than her husband, and the woman doctor Han fell for in his wife&#39;s absence seems to be falling for the hospital&#39;s new pathologist, a long-distance ocean sailor from South Africa with some unique experience in third-world killing fields. As the answers to Han&#39;s questions emerge from the cultural chaos like the ghosts that haunt Samoan forests, he discovers that the last blind spot is his own. And it may kill him.&lt;/P&gt;" />
