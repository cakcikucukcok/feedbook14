  <title>Fourth Down - Dave Klein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Once Ed Buck, sports reporter, and Adam Benson, star quarterback for the Chicago Bears, played football on the same college team.  Years later, they are still close friends.  In New York for a game against the Giants, Benson hands Buck the biggest story of his career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gambling on football is one of the country&#39;s leading &quot;industries,&quot; and the mob&#39;s been forcing Benson to throw games.  The quarterback has had enough.  Sunday, he tells Buck, he&#39;s playing to win, and to hell with the mob.  After the game, Buck can run with the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adam Benson never makes it off the field alive, and Ed Buck suspects his friend was murdered.  Buck knows barely enough to convince a police detective to look into Benson&#39;s death--but more than enough to set the mob on his tail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Lt. Gerry Keegan probes the tangled connections between the dead quarterback and the head of an organized crime family, uncovering drug dealing, murder, blackmail, prostitution, and double- and triple-crosses, Ed Buck and his fiancee run for their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
