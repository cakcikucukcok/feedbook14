Suddenly, everything changes for Birdie, and everything she believes she knows about her insulated small town life is called into question. Obsessed in figuring out who killed her friend, Birdie spends years trying to find the murderer. Eventually, she connects with someone who is every bit as interested in the case as she is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Someone who knows how close she is to solving the murder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Someone who will kill again to keep her quiet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sandra Moran&lt;/B&gt; authored the critically acclaimed novels &lt;i&gt;Letters Never Sent&lt;/I&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Nudge&lt;/I&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Addendum&lt;/I&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;All We Lack&lt;/I&gt;. Final revisions on &lt;i&gt;State of Grace&lt;/I&gt;, the first novel written, but the last to be published, were completed in September 2015. Less than a month later, she was diagnosed with Stage IV cancer. She passed away in early November. Bywater Books, in concert with her spouse, Cheryl Pletcher, has published the complete manuscript as it was written.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
