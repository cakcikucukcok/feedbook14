      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hong Kong, 1970&lt;/em&gt;. The Dragon Head (also known as the Mountain Master) of the Fanling Triad has died and there is a struggle to replace him among senior members of the gang. Normally, the Deputy Mountain Master is next in line, but this one is weak and ineffectual and has only survived because of the protection of the Dragon Head. Up to this point, the Fanling Triad has operated in relative isolation from neighbouring gangs, but the Dragon Head&amp;#8217;s death has drawn attention to the area &amp;#8212; and to its wealth. Other gangs start to make threatening moves and it&amp;#8217;s obvious to the senior members of the Fanling Triad that they need a leader who can fend off the threats, unite the membership, and maintain their prosperity. There are several candidates. The least conspicuous is the White Paper Fan, their young administrator. His name is Chow Tung, but many of those who work with him already refer to him as &amp;#8220;Uncle&amp;#8221; . . .&lt;/p&gt;" />
