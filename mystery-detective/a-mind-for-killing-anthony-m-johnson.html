  <title>A Mind for Killing - Anthony M. Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If I were you, I would stop trying to separate reality from fantasy. Be it through faith or science, we are no longer limited to the rules that Mother Nature laid out for us during our conception . . . For what good is it to be alive if you have no cause to enjoy it? (chapter 6).
2005. Four men lay dead, assassinated by a famous albino mercenary at the turn of every season. Unrelated, scattered across the states, the best that the FBI can figure is that one of their former agents has gone rogue and is on the verge of something greater when its discovered that his next target is a senator from Tennessee. Why him? Why now? What is his plan?
Only Sylvester Jayden, the FBIs elite detective, can figure it out. Crippled and laden with prosthetics after 9/11 and years of service, she had hoped to retire in peace and far away from the government that had used her until her body had worn out completely. Yet when its verified that its Adrian, her brother, thats committing the killings, shell have to put on her holster one last time to stop him as a conspiracy unfurls, one that threatens the entire world with nuclear war.
Join the familiar cast or start fresh in the fourth entry of The Mercenarys Salvation, the satirical saga written by Anthony M Johnson. Awkward romances, gratuitous violence, and comedic commentary of religion, war, American history, and meta humor wait in this latest hit by the veteran thriller author. So grab a smoke, don your trench coat, and take a seat at the bar. The latest modern noir tale starts here!" />
