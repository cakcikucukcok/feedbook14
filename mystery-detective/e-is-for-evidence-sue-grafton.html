  <title>&quot;E&quot; is for Evidence - Sue Grafton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;No one writes a thriller like #1 &lt;/i&gt;New York Times&lt;i&gt; bestselling author Sue Grafton. In &lt;/i&gt;E is for Evidence&lt;i&gt;, PI Kinsey Millhone becomes the victim of a nasty frame-up...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;E IS FOR EX&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the silly season and a Monday at that, and Kinsey Millhone was bogged down in a preliminary report on a fire claim. Something was nagging at her, but she couldn&#39;t pin it. The last thing she needed in the morning mail was a letter from her bank recording an erroneous $5,000 deposit in her account. Kinsey had never believed in Santa Claus and she wasn&#39;t about to change her mind now. Resigning herself to a morning of frustration, she phoned the bank and, assaulted by canned carols, waited on hold for an officer to clear up the snafu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was with something less than Christmas cheer that Kinsey faced off only minutes later with California Fidelity&#39;s Mac Voorhies. Voorhies was smart, humorless, stingy with praise, and totally fair. He was frowning now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I got a phone call this morning.&quot; he said, his frown deepening. &quot;Somebody says you&#39;re on the take.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly the $5,000 deposit clicked into place. It wasn&#39;t a mistake. It was a setup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;E&quot; is for evidence:  evidence planted, evidence lost. &quot;E&quot; is for ex-lovers and evasions, enemies and endings. For Kinsey, &quot;E&quot; is for everything she stands to lose if she can&#39;t exonerate herself:  her license, her livelihood, her good name. And so she takes on a new client:  namely, Kinsey Millhone, thirty-two and twice-divorced, ex-cop and wisecracking loner, a California private investigator with a penchant for lost causes--one of which, it is to be hoped, is not herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Kinsey begins to unravel the frame-up, she finds that her future is intimately tied to one family&#39;s past and to the explosive secret it has protected for almost twenty years. Digging deeper, she discovers that probing the past can have lethal consequences as she follows a trail of murder that leads to her own front door. And in what may well be her most challenging case, Kinsey comes up against the fact that sometimes, &quot;E&quot; is forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A&quot; Is for Alibi&lt;br&gt;&quot;B&quot; Is for Burglar&lt;br&gt;&quot;C&quot; Is for Corpse&lt;br&gt;&quot;D&quot; Is for Deadbeat&lt;br&gt;&quot;E&quot; Is for Evidence&lt;br&gt;&quot;F&quot; Is for Fugitive&lt;br&gt;&quot;G&quot; Is for Gumshoe&lt;br&gt;&quot;H&quot; Is for Homicide&lt;br&gt;&quot;I&quot; Is for Innocent&lt;br&gt;&quot;J&quot; Is for Judgment&lt;br&gt;&quot;K&quot; Is for Killer&lt;br&gt;&quot;L&quot; is for Lawless&lt;br&gt;&quot;M&quot; Is for Malice&lt;br&gt;&quot;N&quot; Is for Noose&lt;br&gt;&quot;O&quot; Is for Outlaw&lt;br&gt;&quot;P&quot; Is for Peril &lt;br&gt;&quot;Q&quot; Is for Quarry&lt;br&gt;&quot;R&quot; Is for Ricochet &lt;br&gt;&quot;S&quot; Is for Silence &lt;br&gt;&quot;T&quot; Is for Trespass&lt;br&gt;&quot;U&quot; Is for Undertow &lt;br&gt;&quot;V&quot; Is for Vengeance &lt;br&gt;&quot;W&quot; Is for Wasted &lt;br&gt;&quot;X&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
