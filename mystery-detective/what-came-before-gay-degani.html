  <title>What Came Before - Gay Degani</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;What Came Before is a remarkable achievement - a smart, fast-paced mystery that asks important questions about identity, family, and race. And, like the best of its genre, it&#39;s loaded with puzzles: What really happened on the day Abbie Palmer&#39;s mother killed herself? Who is the mysterious woman who shows up on Abbie&#39;s doorstep, and why would anyone want her dead? Gay Degani&#39;s prose is at all times lucid and compelling, and her exciting story will keep you glued to your chair.&quot;  ~ Clifford Garstang, winner of the 2013 Library of Virginia Award for Fiction for &#39;What the Zhang Boys Know&#39;  &quot;With engaging characters and a compelling mystery, Gay Degani&#39;s What Came Before draws you in and doesn&#39;t let go. If this had been a movie, I wouldn&#39;t have left the cinema for more popcorn. A brilliant and complex whodunit with a memorable, imperfect character at its helm.&quot;  ~ Christopher Allen, author of &#39;Conversations with S. Teri O&#39;Type (a Satire)&#39;" />
