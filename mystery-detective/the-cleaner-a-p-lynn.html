  <title>The Cleaner - A.P. Lynn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Arrival, the first book of the Miandi series, Detective Mark Daniels meets Julie Warren, a young entrepreneur, who was renting out his deceased wifes studio. Her involvement in a property scheme case piques his curiosity as to the background of his tenant and the world she lives in. What Mark cannot discover is that Julie is actually an immortal, who has arrived on Earth to attempt to live life as humans do, without her powers or her past getting in the way. Now in The Cleaner, Marks curiosity over his tenant grows stronger, and Julies unwitting involvement in his caseload only heightens her fear that he will discover her secret. 
Mark and his new partner, Detective Cassie Edwards, are assigned to assist the arson team, when a series of arsons claims the son of a prominent Mason City attorney. The investigation reopens deep wounds for Mark, who lost his mother in a fire. They join Lieutenant Lawrence Rutherford and trainee Melanie Keegen in a search for the arsonist and the motive behind the fires. When a new blaze claims a historical home owned by Julies company, Julie is drawn into the mystery. Julie must then fight Marks growing obsession over her and an arsonist whose anger knows no bounds and is not afraid to make Julie or Mark their latest victim." />
