  <title>Cat Chase the Moon - Shirley Rousseau Murphy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feline P. I. Joe Grey and his friends pounce on three investigations that may connect to one larger mystery&amp;#8212;including one case that is very personal&amp;#8212;in this hair-raising installment in Shirley Rousseau Murphy&amp;#8217;s beloved, award-winning series.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe Grey and his partner, Dulcie, are frantic when Courtney, their pretty teen-kitten goes missing. Aided by their two- and four-legged friends, they hit the streets of Molina Point in search of their calico girl. Has Joe Grey and Dulcie&amp;#8217;s only daughter been lured away by someone and stolen? Is she lying somewhere hurt, or worse?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtney has no idea that everyone is desperately looking for her. Locked in an upstairs apartment above the local antiques shop, she&amp;#8217;s enjoying her first solo adventure. When she first met Ulrich Seaver, the shop&amp;#8217;s owner, Courtney was frightened. But the human has coddled and pampered her, winning her trust. Sheltered by her parents, her brothers, and her kind human companions, the innocent Courtney is unaware of how deceptive strangers can be. She doesn&amp;#8217;t know that Ulrich is hiding a dangerous secret that could threaten her and everyone in this charming California coastal village.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With his focus on finding Courtney, Joe Grey has neglected his detective work with the Molina Point Police Department. Before his daughter disappeared, Joe found a viciously beaten woman lying near the beach. Now the police investigation has stalled, and the clever feline worries his human colleagues may have missed a vital clue. Joe is also concerned about a family of newcomers whose domestic battles are disturbing the town&amp;#8217;s tranquility. Loud and abrasive, the Luthers&amp;#8217; angry arguing, shouting, and swearing in the early hours of the night have neighbors on edge and the cops on alert. One of the couple&amp;#8217;s late-night shouting matches masked the sounds of a burglary, and now a criminal is on the loose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the crimes are as crisscrossed as the strands of a ball of yarn, Joe Grey&amp;#8217;s cat senses tell him they may somehow be linked. It&amp;#8217;s up to the fleet-footed feline and his crime-solving coterie to untangle the mysteries before it&amp;#8217;s too late.&lt;/p&gt;" />
