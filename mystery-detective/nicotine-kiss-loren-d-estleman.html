  <title>Nicotine Kiss - Loren D. Estleman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this installment of Loren Estleman&#39;s signature PI series, Amos Walker, the quintessential hard-boiled detective, proves that he&#39;s mortal after all. Jeff Starzek, an old friend who smuggles cigarettes for a living, saves Walker&#39;s life, getting him to the hospital after he&#39;s taken a bullet in the leg. A month later, still convalescing, Walker gets a panicked phone call from Starzek&#39;s sister. Jeff is missing. One of the few leads is a Homeland Security agent who&#39;s after Starzek, in connection with a counterfeiting operation that may have terrorist ties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though Walker doubts Starzek is a terrorist, he finds treasury paper at a church run by Starzek&#39;s brother. Then Starzek&#39;s brother disappears too. Back to square one, Walker follows his best hunch, driving Starzek&#39;s usual cigarette route along the Lake Huron shore, and finally gets a solid lead on the paper hangers. But before Walker can break the case, someone tries to shoot him--and he&#39;s accused of murder. Walker will need all of his intestinal fortitude, injured leg notwithstanding, to stay alive long enough to figure out who&#39;s doing what to whom, in time to save his friend, in &lt;i&gt;Nicotine Kiss.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
