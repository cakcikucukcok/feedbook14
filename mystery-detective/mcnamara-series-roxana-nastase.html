  <title>McNamara Series - Roxana Nastase</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Improbable killers. A stubborn and relentless detective. Misleading evidence. To muddle the waters, a tempting young woman worms her way in the cold detective&amp;rsquo;s heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McNamara, a Scottish C.I., fights crime in the streets of Edinburgh and in its suburbs. Diagnosed with Asperger as a child, the detective is meticulous, cold and dedicated. He is interested in doing his job and is a master in avoiding any kind of sentimental involvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first novel, the C.I. chases an elusive killer who blends well with the people on the Nightingale Street and makes the police run in circle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A scream wakes up everyone living on Nightingale Street and unleashes a series of events that will dig up secrets and turn the peaceful suburban street into a living nightmare. People won&amp;#39;t know where or who to turn to. General mistrust accompanies the man hunt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, the Chief-Inspector, known to everyone as a cold man, seems to lose his mind when he meets a young woman caught in the events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second novel of the series will baffle you. Nothing is what it seems to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A beheaded victim leads to revealing a sordid story. Throw a new crime in the middle, and you may get lost in the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow McNamara and his team in his quest to find a bold murderer. Even though many might think the killer should be decorated, McNamara must follow the letter of the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shy love story seasons the darkness of the crimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you love a good traditional crime story, then this is the book to you. Buy it and spend a nice afternoon &amp;ndash; or two with a compelling and riveting story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Join McNamara in his hunt and fall in love with the young woman that catches his eye. Intrigue, suspense and cynical humor, together with unique characters, create a thrilling atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;" />
