  <title>The Roads to Damascus - Lynda McDaniel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Abit Bradshaw is back! Four years after that fateful summer in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;A Life for a Life&lt;/em&gt;, Abit Bradshaw faces the biggest challenge of his life. When a family of con artists fleeces his school and casts suspicion on him, Abit, with the support of his friends Della Kincaid and Alex Covington, sets out to find them and get payback. He takes a life-changing journey from Washington, D.C., through the mountains of Virginia, and finally home again to Laurel Falls, N.C. Along the way, he encounters a slew of characters&amp;mdash;from sinners to saints&amp;mdash;who help him discover his rightful place in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise for Lynda McDaniel&amp;rsquo;s Books&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I just finished &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;The Road to Damascus&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;rdquo; having previously read &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;A Life For A Life&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;rdquo; Like delicious hors d&amp;#39;oeuvres, they left me panting for the next installment. I hope to God the delightful Fiona becomes Abit&amp;#39;s second half. Ireland is a very important part of Appalachia&amp;#39;s soul; it seems fitting that Abit finds fulfillment in an Irish rose. I find your fiction revealing of the human condition.&amp;quot; &amp;mdash;J. Porter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;GREAT !! BOOK &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Life for a Life&lt;/em&gt; is outstanding. Great character development, real and believable. A good mystery that reads like a literary piece. Della Kincaid is wonderful. READ THIS ONE.&amp;quot; &amp;mdash;James Wooley?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Five Stars! &lt;/strong&gt;Lynda McDaniel has that wonderfully appealing way of weaving a story, much in the manner of Fannie Flagg. This mystery is] a real treat to read and made me anticipate meeting the characters in yet another installment.&amp;quot; &amp;mdash;Deb? D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;A Life for a Life &lt;/em&gt;is one of the most satisfying books I&amp;rsquo;ve read this year. &lt;/strong&gt;Everything about the book delighted me. &lt;em&gt;A Life for a Life&lt;/em&gt; has also been compared to &lt;em&gt;To Kill a Mockingbird&lt;/em&gt;. Both are character-driven and back a strong message of forgiveness, redemption and acceptance.&amp;quot; &amp;mdash;Ana Manwaring, writer, blogger, creative writing instructor&lt;/p&gt;" />
