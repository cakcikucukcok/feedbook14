  <title>Cape Diamond - Ron Corbett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Cape Diamond&lt;/cite&gt;, the second book in the Frank Yakabuski Mystery series, is atmospheric and action-packed. Set near the Northern Divide — as was the first installment, Edgar Award nominee (Best Paperback Original), &lt;cite&gt;Ragged Lake&lt;/cite&gt; — the book opens with Yakabuski called to investigate a gruesome crime scene. A body has been left hanging from a schoolyard fence. On closer inspection, Yak finds a large diamond in the murder victim’s mouth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two criminal gangs — the Shiners and the Travellers — are fighting with each other, and Yakabuski turns to his father, a now-retired detective who has a long history with the gangs, for advice in the interrogation. Is the conflict over the murder of two men? The kidnapping of a little girl? Or, possibly, the diamond found in Augustus Morrissey’s mouth? As if this weren’t enough for one detective, a serial killer is taking a deadly road trip through the United States, heading towards the Northern Divide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ron Corbett weaves the various strands together with ingenuity, making &lt;cite&gt;Cape Diamond&lt;/cite&gt; a brooding, suspense-filled story of hubris, betrayal, and evil deeds; his writing is sparse and taut, compelling the reader to follow the action and gang conflict to a surprise ending.&lt;/p&gt;" />
