      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A murder in a quiet English village, long-buried secrets and a man&#39;s search for answers about his traumatic past entangle FBI agents Emma Sharpe and Colin Donovan in the latest edge-of-your-seat Sharpe &amp; Donovan novel&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As a young boy, international art thief Oliver York witnessed the murder of his wealthy parents in their London apartment. The killers kidnapped him and held him in an isolated Scottish ruin, but he escaped, thwarting their plans for ransom. Now, after thirty years on the run, one of the two men Oliver identified as his tormentors may have surfaced.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Emma Sharpe and Colin Donovan are enjoying the final day of their Irish honeymoon when a break-in at the home of Emma&#39;s grandfather, a renowned art collector, points to Oliver. Emma and Colin are desperate to question him, but when they arrive at York&#39;s country home, a man is dead and Oliver has vanished.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As the danger mounts, new questions arise about Oliver&#39;s account of his boyhood trauma. Do Emma and Colin dare trust him? With the trail leading beyond Oliver&#39;s small village to Ireland, Scotland and their own turf in the United States, the stakes are high, and Emma and Colin must unravel the decades-old tangle of secrets and lies before a killer strikes again.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;New York Times bestselling author Carla Neggers delivers the gripping, suspense-filled tale readers have been waiting for.&lt;/strong&gt;
