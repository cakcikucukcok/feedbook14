  <title>The Shanghai Tunnel - Sharan Newman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Portland, 1868. It is a rough hewn place, an exploding trading post that has dreams of becoming a metropolis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Horace Stratton, one of Portland&#39;s wealthiest heirs, has decided to come home for good after amassing yet another fortune in Shanghai. With him comes his wife Emily, a shy daughter of missionaries, and their teenaged son. On the brink of that happy return, Horace suddenly falls ill and dies in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emily and her son bring her husband home to Portland and they try to settle into this new culture. While they look as if they should belong, Portland is a strange and unsettling place for them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emily is guilt-ridden, but sorrow is one of the few emotions she didn&#39;t feel when told of her husband&#39;s passing. For Emily had learned more about her husband&#39;s past than anyone would believe. And she discovers that all of his schemes did not die with him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His partners very much want Emily and her son to go away... by whatever means necessary. Emily will have to delve into her husband&#39;s seedy and painful past and set things right so that she can make a life for herself and her son in this strange land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
