  <title>Vengeance Knows No Limits - Ellen Jensen-Dean</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Excerpt for Xlibris Web Page
Running away seemed had become an unwelcome necessity.  With great sadness this part of her life was over, but she didnt have time to grieve.  The reality was she had to go now or miss her flight and probably even lose her life.
Finally satisfied that she was ready, picked up the remaining overnight case and opened the door.  She nearly dropped it as there face to face was the same ugly man who had attacked her only a couple of nights before.
	She caught her breath as he leered at her.  Going somewhere, girlie?
	Get out of my way or Ill scream.
	I dont think so, he said pointing the gun, half hidden under his jacket, at her midsection.  Im not a patient man, Bets.  In your job I bet youve seen people with their guts blown out.  Not a pretty sight, is it?
	At that he shoved her back so that she hit the stair rail as he moved quickly into the room and closed the door behind him.  His eyes never left her face.  He wanted to see fear written all over that pretty puss of hers.
	He knew her name.  Not Astrid, but Bets.
	Who are you?  What do you want? she asked recovering her footing.  She was cornered.  They were alone!
	Dont you know? My boss sent you a letter that should have arrived by now, he said grinning revealing the missing front tooth she had noted the other night.
	Chester, she said her heart pounding.  She had often been afraid, especially during the recent past, but not fear like this since that day long ago.
	Yea, he asked me to take care of you because as you know hes kind of tied up right now, he said with the same sinister chuckle.  Hes not too happy with you.  Says, you ruined his life.
	He ruined his own life, she said quietly looking him squarely in the eye.  Hurting me isnt going to help him.
	He doesnt see it that way, he said spitting on the polished floor.
	So what are you planning to do? she asked thinking she was going to throw up any minute.
	Physically she knew she was no match for him.  He had proved that during the previous assault.  Maybe if she talked long enough someone would come, but who?
	Whats your name? she asked trying to maintain that cool she had always been known for and hoping to make some kind of connection.
	Maynard, but what do you care?  If you think knowing my name will help the cops catch me, forget it, lady.  You wont be around.  Dead girls dont talk.  He spit the words at her.
	So this was how it was going to end.  In spite of everything she had done to avoid this, it had all been in vain.  Had it not been so tragic the irony would be laughable." />
