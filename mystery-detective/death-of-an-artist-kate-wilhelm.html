  <title>Death of an Artist - Kate Wilhelm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In Kate Wilhelm&#39;s latest crime novel, a small Oregon town is rocked by a wheels-within-wheels case of art, fraud, and murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silver Bay, Oregon, a small coastal resort town with nearly a thousand residents, is home to three generations of women: Marnie, the long-widowed owner of a small gift shop; Van, her granddaughter who is about to graduate medical school; and Stef, mercurial, difficult, and a brilliant artist who refuses to sell her work. When Stef discovers that Dale Oliver--the latest husband/paramour in a very long line--is trying to sell her work behind her back, she puts a stop to it and threatens to do the same to him. Shortly thereafter, Stef dies in an accident in her studio, and Dale shows up with a signed contract granting him the right to sell her work. Convinced that Stef was murdered in order to steal her artwork, Marie and Van--grandmother and granddaughter--decide to do whatever is necessary to see that Dale doesn&#39;t get away with any of it. This includes enlisting the help of the new stranger in town, Tony, a former New York City cop, who might be the only one who can prove it was murder&lt;br&gt;and bring the killer to justice.&lt;/p&gt;" />
