  <title>Sweetheart - Chelsea Cain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With &lt;i&gt;Heartsick&lt;/i&gt;, Chelsea Cain took the crime world by storm, introducing two of the most compelling characters in decades: serial killer Gretchen Lowell and her obsessed pursuer Portland Detective Archie Sheridan. The book spent four weeks on the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller list and garnered rave reviews around the world. But the riveting story of Archie and Gretchen was left unfinished, and now Chelsea Cain picks up the tale again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the body of a young woman is discovered in Portland&#39;s Forest Park, Archie is reminded of the last time they found a body there, more than a decade ago: it turned out to be the Beauty Killer&#39;s first victim, and Archie&#39;s first case. This body can&#39;t be one of Gretchen&#39;s--she&#39;s in prison--but after help from reporter Susan Ward uncovers the dead woman&#39;s identity, it turns into another big case. Trouble is, Archie can&#39;t focus on the new investigation because the Beauty Killer case has exploded: Gretchen Lowell has escaped from prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archie hadn&#39;t seen her in two months; he&#39;d moved back in with his family and sworn off visiting her. Though it should feel like progress, he actually feels worse. The news of her escape spreads like wildfire, but secretly, he&#39;s relieved. He knows he&#39;s the only one who can catch her, and in fact, he has a plan to get out from under her thumb once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chelsea Cain has topped her own bestselling debut thriller with this unputdownable, unpredictable, edge-of-your-seat read.&lt;/p&gt;" />
