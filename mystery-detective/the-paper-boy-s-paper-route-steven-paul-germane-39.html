  <title>The Paper Boy’S Paper Route - Steven Paul-Germane&#39;</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nothing is hidden forever; eventually it all becomes uncovered. The truth has a way of coming out regardless of how dark it may be. Even best-kept secrets arent really kept forever. Whats done in the dark will come to the light, but the only question is, can you handle it?
No ones afraid of the priest who lived down the lane, near the church that he ministered at years ago, when he was a God-fearing man. No ones afraid of the rumors that hes Satan himself since the death of his son Marshall Roberts, twenty years ago, and his sons lover, Christian Thomas. No one believed that the spring between Mr. Roberts house and the church had strange powers and that there are three sayings tied to the water itself. No ones afraid of anything anymore. Until now!
Vengeance has a new name, and its Natas Roberts, and he will stop at nothing until the injustice that was committed against his son and his sons lover is justified. Twenty years ago a horrendous crime took place and a promise for revenge was made with the sacrificing of souls and all those involved would pay when their firstborn sons turned twenty. Time is up. And the strange thing is, no one involved realized that their children were born during the three days it took for the local police to find the bodies of the two lovers during the weekend of June 27th, 28th and 29th.
Christian Marshalls didnt believe in legends or folklore or old stories about mystical waters and springs and the stories that Mr. Roberts was the devil himself, and over the years, several fraternity boys went missing after visiting him or they came out as gay because of the rumors that they were sexually intimate with Mr. Roberts. In fact, rumor had it that Mrs. Roberts sacrificed her soul so that her husband could have the power to carry out their revenge plot and also that she did it so that her son and his lover could live again, someday. . . especially since they died on their twentieth birthday also. 
Christian and his best friend, Kelsey, had no idea what their twentieth birthday had in store for them, and they didnt have a lot of time to make sure they lived to see their twenty-first one. In fact, they had no idea what the next three days would entail at all. But theyd soon find out. The hard way!" />
