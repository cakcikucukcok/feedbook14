  <title>Time Killer - Todd M. Thiede</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the small city of Rockton, Illinois, someone is tired of waiting. Hes tired of standing in line at the grocery store and tired of waiting at the drive-through line. Now hes doing something about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first murder rocks the city. The entire Bjornson familyexcept the father, Stephenhas been brutally murdered, and the killer has left a message behind, written in the victims blood: Dont Waste Peoples Time. Its a grizzly start for two young detectives whove just become partners. But Max Larkin and Jesse Fairlane put their personal distaste for each other aside and start concentrating on how to find the killer from striking again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they investigate the scene of the crime and interview Stephen at the hospital, the clues slowly begin to add up. Could this be a deranged killer who struck ten years ago and has now returned to the area? Before they can answer that question, another murder is reported, and Max and Jesse suddenly realize they have a serial killer on the loose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as they get closer to the truth, a past memory begins to haunt Max, one that might lead to a break in the caseor the end of his career.&lt;/p&gt;" />
