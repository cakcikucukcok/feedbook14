  <title>Wings over the Watcher - Priscilla Masters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Struggling to keep a tight focus on her work after a miscarriage and relationship breakdown, DI Joanna Piercy resorts to formulaic solutions to solve her cases: having seen the same situations time and again, she assumes all cases have a simple repetitive answer. So when Arthur Pennington enters her office in a state of confused distress and reports that his wife Beatrice is missing, Joanna does not reciprocate his concern. Convinced that his wife is merely involved in an extra-marital affair, Joanna is dismissive of Arthur&amp;#8217;s concerns. Then Beatrice&amp;#8217;s strangled body is discovered recklessly dumped on the Leek moorlands and she is forced to re-evaluate her stance. But perhaps Joanna wasn&amp;#8217;t so far off the mark at all: it seems Beatrice suffered an unrequited love, which Joanna knows can be painful&amp;#133;but she never before believed it could be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A baffling and intriguing mystery, &lt;i&gt;Wings over the Watcher&lt;/i&gt; takes the reader on a fascinating journey through the maze-like puzzle of the female psyche.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
