  <title>The Fortune Teller - Gwendolyn Womack</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;NOW A &lt;i&gt;USA TODAY&lt;/i&gt; AND &lt;i&gt;LOS ANGELES TIMES&lt;/i&gt; BESTSELLER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;The Memory Painter &lt;/i&gt;comes a sweeping and suspenseful tale of romance, fate, and fortune. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Semele Cavnow appraises antiquities for an exclusive Manhattan auction house, deciphering ancient texts--and when she discovers a manuscript written in the time of Cleopatra, she knows it will be the find of her career. Its author tells the story of a priceless tarot deck, now lost to history, but as Semele delves further, she realizes the manuscript is more than it seems. Both a memoir and a prophecy, it appears to be the work of a powerful seer, describing devastating wars and natural disasters in detail thousands of years before they occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more she reads, the more the manuscript begins to affect Semele&#39;s life. But what happened to the tarot deck? As the mystery of her connection to its story deepens, Semele can&#39;t shake the feeling that she&#39;s being followed. Only one person can help her make sense of it all: her client, Theo Bossard. Yet Theo is arrogant and elusive, concealing secrets of his own, and there&#39;s more to Semele&#39;s desire to speak with him than she would like to admit. Can Semele even trust him?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The auction date is swiftly approaching, and someone wants to interfere--someone who knows the cards exist, and that the Bossard manuscript is tied to her. Semele realizes it&#39;s up to her to stop them: the manuscript holds the key to a two-thousand-year-old secret, a secret someone will do anything to possess.&lt;/p&gt;" />
