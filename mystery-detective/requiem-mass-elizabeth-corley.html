  <title>Requiem Mass - Elizabeth Corley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The first deaths are just a warm-up...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Buried Past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Deborah Fearnside, a young wife and mother, goes missing, police interest is minimal.  She would hardly be the first woman to abandon a tired marriage.  Four weeks later it is Detective Chief Inspector Andrew Fenwick, back from compassionate leave, who notices the set of coincidences that should have transformed a routine missing person&#39;s case into a suspected abduction.  But by then it is too late for Debbie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Dark Secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty years ago, a young woman fell tragically to her death. The only people with her were four schoolfriends. One--or maybe all of them--is responsible. Now there&#39;s someone intent on letting them have their just deserts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Bloody Revenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fenwick is soon caught in a desperate race against time to find the murderer before he completes his brutal vendetta. As the death toll mounts, Fenwick stares failure in the face--unless he can draw the predator out of the shadows and into an unconventional and highly dangerous trap with the ultimate bait in &lt;i&gt;Requiem Mass&lt;/i&gt;, a chilling Sussex mystery from Elizabeth Corley. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;Requiem Mass&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;These characters are well drawn, especially Fenwick, and even the killer avoids cliché. Boasting a very tense, superb ending, this second in a gritty new series (following &lt;i&gt;Fatal Legacy&lt;/i&gt;, 2001) shows tremendous promise and is sure to appeal to fans of Tana French, Benjamin Black, and Tess Gerritsen.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Booklist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
