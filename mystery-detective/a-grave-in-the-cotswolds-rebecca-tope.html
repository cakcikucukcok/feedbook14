  <title>A Grave in the Cotswolds - Rebecca Tope</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Undertaker Drew Slocombe is not having a good day. His business is failing, the car needs an MOT and he&#39;s driving 120 miles to the Cotswolds to carry out the late Greta Simmonds&#39; final wishes. Unfortunately, when he gets there, a string of mistakes leaves him the chief suspect of a murder inquiry. He&#39;s beginning to wish he had never heard of Greta Simmonds. Thea Osborne is still pursuing her occupation as house-sitter, despite the disastrous incidents of the past. While staying in Greta Simmonds&#39; house, currently between ownership, she is torn between moving back home or waiting for the execution of the will. Then the discovery of a body in a nearby field takes the decision out of Thea&#39;s hands, and she finds herself embroiled in a murder investigation once again. But Thea believes Drew Slocombe is innocent. As Thea and Drew work together to clear his name, it slowly dawns on them that in a village simmering with secrets, a means and a motive could be laid at anybody&#39;s door." />
