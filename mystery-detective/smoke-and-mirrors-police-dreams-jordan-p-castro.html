  <title>Smoke and Mirrors: Police Dreams - Jordan P. Castro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Xlibris author Jordan P. Castro has seen his book Smoke and Mirrors: Police Dreams reviewed by the New York Times. The review praises Jordan Castro&#39;s prose and writing, comparing it to the works of such writers as Mike Hammer. The New York Times review also positively upholds Jordan Castro&#39;s dialogue, citing it as gritty and emotionally evocative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jordan Castro is an active NYPD sergeant who began assembling his literary painting on the pages of his police memorandum pad and restaurant napkins while on patrol in the Bronx and Harlem. Born in Washington Heights to Cuban parents, his dreams were supported and nurtured by a mother and father who enrolled him in arts programs where he cultivated the bold strokes of his vivid writing style. Inspired by English teachers, who awakened him to the universes of Shakespeare, Jane Austen, and F. Scott Fitzgerald, Jordan believed it was his destiny to contribute memorably to the literary landscape while honoring his predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;
