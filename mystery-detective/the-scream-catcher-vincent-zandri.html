  <title>The Scream Catcher - Vincent Zandri</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;From acclaimed Thriller Award-winning author Vincent Zandri comes a novel of suspense that will have you turning pages long into the night.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is how your life ends: Not with a whimper, but a scream!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Jude Parish is afraid. The former violent crimes cop turned best-selling true crime author has a fear-filled demon lodged inside of him. A demon so real he can only imagine a slimy reptilian beast with scaly skin, black eyes, and razor-sharp fangs having taken up residence inside the place where his once confident and fearless soul resided.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Now, in the wake of his literary success, the ever anxious Jude is hoping to lead a quiet, peaceful life in the idyllic Adirondack vacation town of Lake George, New York with his new pregnant wife, Rosie, and Jack, his young son from a previous marriage. But when Jude becomes the accidental witness to a bizarre &quot;kill game&quot; in which the killer, video game designer and master of disguise, Hector &quot;the Black Dragon&quot; Lennox, insists on recording the screams of his victims prior to shooting them dead, the ex-cop&#39;s life is turned upside down.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When Lennox is arrested by the L.G.P.D. and Jude is asked to act as the state&#39;s star witness, he has no choice but to fight his demon-fear and take on the role. But what he doesn&#39;t realize at the time, is that the killer&#39;s arrest is actually the first level in what is a carefully designed and scripted first-person video kill game that will involve his entire family as players and victims.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;How will the kill game end?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Like all violent video games, it will end in death. But it won&#39;t be Game Over until Hector Lennox catches the screams of his tortured victims.&lt;/div&gt;" />
