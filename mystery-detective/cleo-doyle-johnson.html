  <title>Cleo - Doyle Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;After a homeless man witnesses a double homicide, he begins a run for his life with two valises that hold the secret to the murder.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cleo Hertzwitz has hit rock bottom. His worldly possessions consist of a pair of jeans, a sweatshirt, a knife, and an old overcoat. Through no fault of his own, the former white-collar executive and family man is penniless, desperate, and clinging to the hope that one day he will find his way back home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Cleo inadvertently witnesses a murder in a dark alley, he crawls from hiding and grabs two valises left next to the bodies of the dead men. Now on the run for his life, Cleo hops on a boxcar to escape, not realizing that someone witnessed him running from the murder scene. Now, the police have added Cleo to their list of suspects. Meanwhile, Cleo finds a job, a place to stay, and a new lifeall while keeping the valises a secret from everyone. Caught between two worlds and sought by both police and gangsters, Cleo is about to discover that he unwittingly holds the key to solving a double murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this chilling thriller, a homeless man must rely on the kindness of strangers and his gut instincts to outsmart those determined to stand in the way of his return to a peaceful existence.&lt;/p&gt;" />
