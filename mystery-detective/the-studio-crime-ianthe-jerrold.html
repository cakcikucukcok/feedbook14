He has been murdered. About half an hour ago. By a long knife  passed under the left shoulder&amp;#150;blade into the heart.&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a fog&amp;#150;bound London night, a soir&amp;#233;e is taking place in the studio of artist Laurence Newtree. The guests include an eminent psychiatrist, a wealthy philanthropist and an observant young friend of Newtree&amp;#8217;s, John Christmas. Before the evening is over, Newtree&amp;#8217;s neighbour is found stabbed to death in what appears to be an impossible crime. But a mysterious man in a fez has been spotted in the fog asking for highly unlikely directions...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resourceful John Christmas takes on the case, unofficially, leading to an ingenious solution no one could have expected, least of all Inspector Hembrow of Scotland Yard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Studio Crime&lt;/i&gt; is the first of Ianthe Jerrold&amp;#8217;s classic whodunit novels, originally published in 1929. Its impact led to her membership of the elite Detection Club, and its influence can be felt on later works by John Dickson Carr, Ngaio Marsh and Dorothy L. Sayers among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This edition, the first in over eighty years, features a new introduction by crime fiction historian Curtis Evans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;The Studio Crime&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#147;The best out of a new batch of detective stories.&amp;#8221; J.B.
