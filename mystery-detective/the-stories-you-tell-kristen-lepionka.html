  <title>The Stories You Tell - Kristen Lepionka</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Lepionka is setting a high standard for crime fiction.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Booklist&lt;/i&gt; (starred review) on &lt;i&gt;What You Want to See&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Stories You Tell&lt;/i&gt; is &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shamus Award-winning and &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anthony &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;and &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Macavity Award-nominated author Kristen Lepionka&#39;s heart-pounding third novel that will keep readers on the edge of their seats with her signature twists and mile-high stakes.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A late-night phone call is never good news, especially when you&#39;re Roxane Weary. This one is from her brother Andrew, whose evening was interrupted by an urgent visit from Addison, a hip young DJ and one-time fling, who turns up at his apartment scared and begging to use his phone. She leaves as quickly as she appeared, but now Andrew is worried--especially when Addison never makes it home and her friends and family demand to know where she is. As the police begin to suspect that something may have happened to her, and that Andrew is involved, Roxane tracks Addison&#39;s digital footprint as she goes deeper and deeper into the events preceding her disappearance. Meanwhile, a cop is found dead on the opposite side of town, leading to a swirl of questions surrounding a dance club whose staff--which includes Addison--has suddenly gone AWOL. As Roxane struggles to distinguish the truth from the stories people tell about themselves online, it&#39;s clear that the mystery of Addison&#39;s whereabouts is just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;" />
