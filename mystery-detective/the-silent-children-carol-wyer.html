The recipient is unnamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Detective Robyn Carter&lt;/b&gt; knows this secret is the key to the case, but his friends and family don&amp;#x2019;t offer any clues, and all her team have to go on is a size-ten footprint. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a nurse is found in a pool of blood at the bottom of her staircase, and a seemingly insignificant detail in her friend&amp;#x2019;s statement makes Robyn wonder: are the two bodies connected, and has the killer only just begun?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When another body confirms Robyn&amp;#x2019;s worst fears, she realises she&amp;#x2019;s in a race against time to stop the killer before they strike again. But just as she thinks she&amp;#x2019;s closing in, one of her own team goes missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buried in the past is a terrible injustice. Can Robyn uncover the truth before another life is lost?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;An absolutely heart-stopping and compelling serial killer thriller that will keep you up all night.
