  <title>White Thunder - Aimée Thurlo, David Thurlo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In &lt;i&gt;White Thunder&lt;/i&gt;, the tenth Ella Clah novel from Aimee and David Thurlo, Ella must find a missing FBI agent who interrupted a Sing. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FBI area supervisor Simmons asks the Navajo Tribal Police to help locate Andrew Thomas, a federal agent who disappeared after interrupting a Navajo ritual being performed by a group of medicine men or &lt;i&gt;hataaliis&lt;/i&gt;. Simmons voices his displeasure when Special Investigator Ella Clah is assigned to the case; he believes that Ella became an FBI agent, more than a decade earlier, due to affirmative action-and that she left because the job was too tough for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ella ignores Simmons&#39; pettiness, knowing that finding the missing man is the highest priority.  She won&#39;t allow family issues to get in the way, so she asks her daughter&#39;s father to become a full-time parent for the duration of her investigation.  She even questions her brother, a &lt;i&gt;hataalii&lt;/i&gt; himself, about Agent Thomas.  Could a medicine man have punished Thomas for disturbing the Sing?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Startlingly, Ella receives a disturbing cell phone call that seems to be from Thomas himself.  He&#39;s trapped in a dark place, lost and hurt.  Ella realizes that time is running out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the&lt;i&gt; hataaliis&lt;/i&gt; cleared, Ella follows up on Thomas&#39;s investigation into Social Security fraud.  She is disturbed to see evidence that seems to point to her old friend and Thomas&#39;s immediate superior, FBI agent Blalock.  Could Blalock steal money and assault one of his own men?  Ella can&#39;t believe it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fraud trail leads through a maze of paperwork, banks, government offices, mortuaries, and into the Navajos&#39; most dearly held-beliefs about death.  Only by finding the truth-and fast-will Ella be able to save Andrew Thomas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
