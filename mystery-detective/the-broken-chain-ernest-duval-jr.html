  <title>The Broken Chain - Ernest Duval Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As the speaker of the House of Representatives, Joseph Adam is used to being in control. From his position he makes things happen, crushes his enemiesboth political and personaland enjoys all the many trappings of power. Life is good, because he has the authority to make it so.&lt;p&gt;
When he first starts hearing reports of chaos and panic in the nations cities, he assumes that this too can be controlled and confined. Soon, no one will be in control, and he has no way to change that. The world, as he knows it, no longer exists.&lt;p&gt;
The world is now under attack from a zombie virus.&lt;p&gt;
Caught in the middle of the unthinkable, Joseph struggles to make sense of the new reality. Hes torn apart by anguish as one by one, his friends, family, neighbors, and peers fall victim to the virus. No one is safe, not even the elite and the powerful. As if that stress werent enough, hes just been informed that he is the highest-ranking elected official in the land.&lt;p&gt;
As the newand potentially lastpresident of the United States, Joseph and his best friend, Jason Wright, must now do what needs to be done to save humanity." />
