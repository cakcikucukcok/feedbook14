  <title>Eleven Days - Stav Sherez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;From the author of &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Dark Redemption&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Book Two in the Carrigan and Miller series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is eleven days before Christmas, and an early morning fire rages through a West London square, engulfing a convent tucked within a handsome residential neighborhood. Detectives Jack Carrigan and Geneva Miller arrive at the dreadful scene to find eleven dead bodies&amp;mdash;but there were only ten nuns in residence. Despite the department&amp;rsquo;s top brass pressing for the case to be solved before the holidays, the detectives suspect more than mere arson. Why did the nuns make no move to escape the fire? Who is the eleventh victim? And where is the convent&amp;rsquo;s influential priest liaison to the church, the one man who can answer their questions?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shortlisted for the coveted Old Peculier Novel of the Year award, Eleven Days, the new entry in Sherez&amp;rsquo;s acclaimed series which began with &lt;i&gt;A Dark Redemption&lt;/i&gt;, follows Carrigan and Miller as they unravel an elaborate mystery that spans four decades and two continents. On their second case together, the partners, at once fresh and familiar, confront both their haunting pasts and the dangers that threaten to cut short their futures. As pressure intensifies to close the case, they struggle to solve a hidden history whose exposure threatens both the church and the political establishment." />
