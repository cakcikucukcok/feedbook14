  <title>Weeding Out Trouble - Heather Webber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Landscaper Nina Quinn would do anything for her employees. After all, Taken by Surprise, her garden makeover business, wouldn&#39;t be blooming if it weren&#39;t for them. So when Kit Pipe, her right-hand handyman, goes missing, Nina immediately starts digging into his disappearance. But all she finds is Daisy Bedinghaus, Kit&#39;s ex&amp;#8212;and she&#39;s dead as dirt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An ex-con who&#39;d been dumped by Daisy not long before her murder, Kit&#39;s the prime suspect. But Nina&#39;s determined to prove his innocence and nip this whole thing in the bud. After all, it&#39;ll get her out of her all-too-crowded house, where her ex-husband the cop is recovering from a gunshot wound on her couch and her thorny new stepson is giving her the evil eye. But as she comes closer to unearthing the truth, Nina will find that facing the frost in her home is nothing compared to confronting the real killer&#39;s ice-cold stare.&lt;/p&gt;" />
