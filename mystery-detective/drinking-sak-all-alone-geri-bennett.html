  <title>Drinking Saké All Alone - Geri Bennett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sunao Tokumura, descendent of an old and honorable samurai family, has risen to the powerful post of vice minister in the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry.  Unable to forget the tears of shame shed by his father as Japan surrendered in 1945, Tokumura has vowed vengeance against America.&lt;/p&gt;  
Satoshi Yoshida, aging billionaire industrialist, also seeks revenge against the country that imprisoned him as a war criminal for his support of its enemies in WWII.  His money and influence now extend from the dark corners inhabited by the yakusa to a former president of the United States, and he has discovered a way to manipulate the current president.  Together the two men have devised a plot to destroy the country they both loathe, using innocent Americans and their own countrymen as pawns.&lt;/p&gt;  
Maggie Davidson Stuart, was unable to defy her fathers objections to her Japanese suitor, Stan Mitsunari, and married Charles Stuart, the young banker considered to be of proper background.  Tokumura and Yoshida draw the unsuspecting Stan, now a respected financial editor in Japan, into the scheme as America is thrown into chaos by massive labor strikes, a Treasury bond boycott, and the sabotaging of an innovative computer storage system.  When her father dies suddenly and Charles leaves her for his male lover, Maggie assumes leadership of the prestigious Davidson Hotel Group, the family owned company.  Stan and Maggie are reunited when Stan begins to suspect the vicious plot, but will anyone believe him in time to stop the madness?&lt;/p&gt;" />
