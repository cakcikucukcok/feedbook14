  <title>Murder Isn&#39;t Cricket - E. &amp; M.A. Radford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why should a holidaymaker, sitting to enjoy a game of village cricket, suddenly meet with death in the shape of a flying bullet?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That most English of sporting pastimes: a cricket match between two rivalrous village teams. The game has just ended in a closely fought draw, &amp;nbsp;and the village green is emptied of all spectators, bar one. A dead man is found sitting in a deck chair on the boundary line, clearly shot during the match. The man is a stranger, with no obvious clue to his identity or that of his killer. Nobody has seen or heard the shot fired. The local police are baffled, and call in Scotland Yard. Enter Dr. Manson, investigative detective par excellence, to solve a seemingly impossible crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Murder Isn&amp;rsquo;t Cricket&lt;/em&gt; was originally published in 1946. This new edition includes an introduction by crime fiction historian Nigel Moss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A front-rank place among contemporary writers of crime fiction . . . There is no flagging in the technique of either the authors or of the Doctor&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;Western Morning News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
