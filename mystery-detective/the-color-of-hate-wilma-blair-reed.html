  <title>The Color of Hate - Wilma Blair-Reed</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As a married black couple, Doris and Shaun begin living their American dream in the heart of the racist South in the 1960s. Shaun, a successful financier, and Doris, an educator, have two children together. Like many married couples, they find it tough to juggle their career and family life, while also confronting southern culture&#39;s pervasive racism. In time, Doris suspects her husband could be having an affair. He&#39;s restless; distant. Worse, Doris fears the dalliance may be with a white woman, a race Doris despises.&lt;P&gt; 
Doris&#39; suspicions prove to be on target. Shaun&#39;s one-night fling with Kathleen, a white woman, results in the birth of a child. Before Doris can confront her husband, she finds Kathleen dead. The only witness is Shaun and Kathleen&#39;s traumatized young daughter, Shauna, who doesn&#39;t remember what happened. Doris and Shaun take in Shauna after the tragedy. As she grows, however, her presence causes family heartache. Still, the question lingers: Who killed her mother?&lt;P&gt;
When a videotape surfaces and the truth is revealed, the answer to the mystery sends shockwaves throughout the whole of Atlanta. Compelling and suspenseful, &lt;I&gt;The Color of Hate&lt;/I&gt; will leave you guessing who committed such a crime, and have you reflecting on the issues and implications surrounding racism." />
