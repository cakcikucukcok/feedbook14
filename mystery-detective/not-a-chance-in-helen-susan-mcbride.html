  <title>Not a Chance in Helen - Susan Mcbride</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the third River Road Mystery from &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Susan McBride, Helen Evans knows her friend is not guilty of murder &amp;#8230; she just has to prove it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When 80-year-old Eleanora Duncan is found dead on her kitchen floor, Sheriff Frank Biddle suspects it isn&amp;#39;t from natural causes. Eleanora wasn&amp;#39;t exactly your average senior citizen. She was a widow worth millions, although all her money couldn&amp;#39;t buy her happiness&amp;#8212;not after losing both her husband and son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eleanora&amp;#39;s bitterness alienated those around her, but did that bitterness make her the victim of foul play? Soon Jean Duncan, Eleanora&amp;#39;s daughter-in-law, becomes the prime suspect. But the sheriff gets more than he bargained for when Helen Evans comes to the aid of her friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helen knows that Jean didn&amp;#39;t murder Eleanora, despite the very bad blood between them. So she uses every means at her disposal in order to clear Jean&amp;#39;s name and track down Eleanora&amp;#39;s killer.&lt;/p&gt;" />
