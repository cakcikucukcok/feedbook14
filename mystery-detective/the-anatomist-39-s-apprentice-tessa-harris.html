  <title>The Anatomist&#39;s Apprentice - Tessa Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the first in a stunning new mystery series set in eighteenth-century England, Tessa Harris introduces Dr. Thomas Silkstone, anatomist and pioneering forensic detective.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The death of Sir Edward Crick has unleashed a torrent of gossip through the seedy taverns and elegant ballrooms of Oxfordshire. Few mourn the dissolute young man--except his sister, the beautiful Lady Lydia Farrell. When her husband comes under suspicion of murder, she seeks expert help from Dr. Thomas Silkstone, a young anatomist from Philadelphia. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thomas arrived in England to study under its foremost surgeon, where his unconventional methods only add to his outsider status. Against his better judgment he agrees to examine Sir Edward&#39;s corpse. But it is not only the dead, but also the living, to whom he must apply the keen blade of his intellect. And the deeper the doctor&#39;s investigations go, the greater the risk that he will be consigned to the ranks of the corpses he studies.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advance praise for Tessa Harris and The Anatomist&#39;s Apprentice&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#39;&quot;Tessa Harris has delivered a deftly plotted debut. Just when you think the puzzle is solved, she reveals yet another surprising twist which leaves you marveling at her ingenuity.&quot;          --Carol Carr, author of &lt;i&gt;India Black&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;  &quot;CSI &lt;/i&gt; meets &lt;i&gt;The Age of Reason &lt;/i&gt;with a well-drawn, intriguing cast of characters, headed by the brilliant Dr. Thomas Silkstone.  Full of twists and turns, Tessa Harris&#39;s debut mystery can confound the most adept reader. Vivid details pulled me right into the world of early forensic sleuthing. A page turner!&quot;                 --Karen Harper&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Tessa Harris takes us on a fascinating journey into the shadowy world of anatomist Thomas Silkstone, a place where death holds no mystery and all things are revealed.&quot;  &amp;#8211;Victoria Thompson, author of &lt;i&gt;Murder on Sisters&#39; Row&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &quot;From dissection table to drawing room, this visit to late eighteenth-century England is chock full of intriguing twists and turns.
