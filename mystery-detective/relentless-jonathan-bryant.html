  <title>Relentless - Jonathan Bryant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My name is Derrin Aethelbeorn. Im a college sophomore majoring in communications. Life is great; its hard balancing studies, exams, a daily routine, and a part-time job, but I can adjust to things pretty quickly. 
This is really the first time I cant adjust. 
I was kidnapped. I came to sometime afterward, finding myself imprisoned within this massive concrete structure, awakening to this realization: Im not the only one whos been taken. There are othersmany others. Rumor has it that the one behind all of thisan evil man named The Dark Oneis forcing us to work for him, though we dont know why. Ive sworn to die before becoming a benefactor in this plot to kill innocent civilians, but they tell me the choice may not be mine to make. 
Strange powers are at work here. 
Theres a mystical legend. It speaks of a man called the Liberatora man foretold to rescue the innocent and destroy the Dark One. Its my responsibility to find this man before time runs out. I cannot fail, or all is lost. I will die trying, if need be. I know it all sounds ridiculous, but its true. 
Death and destruction are behind this plot, and Im the only one who can prevent it. Innocent civilians are in harms way; I have to help them, but theres only one way to succeed: I must be relentless." />
