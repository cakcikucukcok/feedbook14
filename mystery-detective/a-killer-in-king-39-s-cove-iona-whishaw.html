When she finds herself happily settled into a sleepy hamlet in the interior of British Columbia surrounded by a suitably eclectic cast of small-town characters she feels like she may finally be able to put her past to rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;book_description&quot;&gt;But then a body is discovered, the victim of murder, and although she works alongside the town&amp;#8217;s inspectors Darling and Ames to discover who might have possibly have motivation to kill, she unknowingly casts doubt on herself. As the investigation reveals facts that she has desperately tried to keep a secret, it threatens to pull her into a vortex of even greater losses than the ones she has already endured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;book_description&quot;&gt;A clever postwar mystery that will appeal to fans the Maisie Dobbs series by Jacqueline Winspear or the Bess Crawford series by Charles Todd. &lt;/p&gt;" />
