  <title>The Dead Girl Reunion - P.K. Ross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For twenty years Jack McCall swore he would never return to his home town. Now, at the urging of his doctor to take a significant step in his alcohol recovery program, and to help ensure the success of his second marriage, he must return to Caldwell, Oregon, to face the people and the memories that kick-started his drinking. His high school class reunion would provide the perfect cover for keeping a low profile while he was in town. With his wife Mollie at his side he could vanquish the personal demons that awaited him, reconnect with a few old friends, and leave town healed. After all, it was just a small-town high school reunion ? a celebration. What could go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jack and Mollie arrive from the east coast in their restored private airplane hoping for a casual visit, but Jack soon learns that events of the past that fueled his guilt and drove him away were not what they had seemed. A catalytic conversation with a classmate morphs their mission from inner healing to investigation, and finally, to confrontation, as they navigate a maze of clues and complex characters, ranging from the city&amp;rsquo;s finest citizens to an international assassin. Jack is driven to find the truth about the girl&amp;rsquo;s death, with the hope that it might rid him of his guilt. Their mission is further complicated by Jack&amp;rsquo;s need to stay sober and their mutual need to laugh, to love, and to cherish their moments together, which is hard to do when someone is trying to kill you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
