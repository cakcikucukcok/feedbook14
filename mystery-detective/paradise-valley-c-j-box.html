  <title>Paradise Valley - C.J. Box</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;She almost caught him once. Now, he&#39;s back. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For three years, Investigator Cassie Dewell has been on a hunt for a serial killer known as the Lizard King whose hunting grounds are the highways and truck stops where runaways and prostitutes are most likely to vanish. Cassie almost caught him...once. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working for the Bakken County, North Dakota sheriff&#39;s department, Cassie has set what she believes is the perfect trap and she has lured him and his truck to a depot. But the plan goes horribly wrong, and the blame falls on Cassie. Disgraced, she loses her job and investigation into her role is put into motion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Kyle Westergaard, a troubled kid whom Cassie has taken under her wing, has disappeared after telling people that he&#39;s going off on a long-planned adventure. Kyle&#39;s grandmother begs Cassie to find him and, with nothing else to do, Cassie agrees--all the while hunting the truck driver. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Cassie is a lone wolf. And in the same way that two streams converge into a river, Kyle&#39;s disappearance may have a more sinister meaning than anyone realizes. With no allies, no support, and only her own wits to rely on, Cassie must take down a killer who is as ruthless as he is cunning. But can she do it alone, without losing her own humanity or her own life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Paradise Valley&lt;/i&gt; continues the  Highway Quartet series from bestselling author C. J. Box.&lt;/p&gt;" />
