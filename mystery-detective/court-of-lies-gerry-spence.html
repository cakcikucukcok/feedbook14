  <title>Court of Lies - Gerry Spence</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From Gerry Spence, one of America&#39;s greatest trial attorneys and the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;How to Argue and Win Every Time, &lt;/i&gt;comes an explosive courtroom thriller of murder, passion, and the twists and treachery of law and justice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lillian Adams is going on trial for the murder of her wealthy husband before Judge John Murray, to whom she has been like a daughter since childhood. Despite this long, shared history, both the prosecutor and defense attorney agree that Murray should sit on the case, and Murray himself knows he must. For he believes that if he steps down and another judge is appointed, there will be little hope for Lillian. The prosecutor is a sadistic psychopath who will pervert the law to convict Lillian and do everything in his power to hurt Judge Murray. And Murray must save Lillian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gerry Spence takes readers through shocking twists and suspenseful courtroom scenes that only the great maestro of the courtroom himself could create. &lt;i&gt;Court of Lies&lt;/i&gt; goes beyond being a great legal thriller. It questions the very basis of our legal system and its ability to discover the truth and deliver justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
