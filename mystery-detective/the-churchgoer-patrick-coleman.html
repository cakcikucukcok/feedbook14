  <title>The Churchgoer - Patrick Coleman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soon to be a an FX series starring and produced by Matthew McConaughey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;LitHub&lt;/em&gt; Most Anticipated Book of Summer &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;The Churchgoer&lt;/em&gt; is a wonderful debut novel from a writer with more than a few tricks up his sleeve.&amp;#8221;--&lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A&amp;#160;haunting debut literary noir about a former pastor&amp;#8217;s search to find a missing woman in the toxic, contradictory underbelly of southern California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;He was finished with church, with God, with all of it. But to find the girl, he has to go back.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Mark Haines&amp;#8217;s former life, he was an evangelical youth pastor, a role model, and a family man&amp;#8212;until he abandoned his wife, his daughter, and his beliefs. Now he&amp;#8217;s marking time between sunny days surfing and dark nights working security at an industrial complex. His isolation is broken when Cindy, a charming twenty-two-year old drifter he sees hitchhiking on the Pacific Coast Highway, hustles him for a breakfast and a place to crash&amp;#8212;two cynical kindred spirits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then his co-worker is murdered in a robbery gone wrong and Cindy disappears on the same night. Haines knows he should let it go and return to his safe life of solitude. Instead, he&amp;#8217;s driven to find out where Cindy went, under stranger and stranger circumstances. Soon Mark is chasing leads, each one taking him back into a world where his old life came crashing down&amp;#8212;into the seedier side of southern California&amp;#8217;s drug trade and ultimately into the secrets of an Evangelical megachurch where his past and his future are about to converge. What begins as an investigation becomes a haunting mystery and a psychological journey both for Mark, and for the elusive young stranger he won&amp;#8217;t let get away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set in the early 2000s, &lt;em&gt;The Churchgoer&lt;/em&gt; is a gripping noir, a quiet subversion of the genre, and a powerful meditation on belief, morality, and the nature of evil in contemporary life.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#160;" />
