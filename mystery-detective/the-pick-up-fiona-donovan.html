  <title>The Pick Up - Fiona Donovan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="John OBryan is American, in his twenties, single and living in North
Central Massachusetts in the 1970s.He works under contract with the
C.I.A. Fearing that he is making the wrong decision, he embarks on his
next assignment working alone, and with strange unknown contacts.
What should have been a simple quick in and out assignment, takes a
bad turn placing him in dire circumstances. Believing that his actions
on a previous assignment had gotten him in his current situation, his
suspicions are confirmed when he is taken captive in the inhospitable
unfriendly jungle region of ElSalvador. Convinced that he will not make
it out alive, he is at the mercy of his captors, one of the many ruthless
bands of drug cartel rebels. Constant physical and mental torture, leaves
his body beaten and badly broken, convinced that he has been set up by
the C.I.A. Experience the fear and terror, physical and psychological pain
that he endures during his entire ordeal. During capture he flashes back
to the previous assignment where he suffers a personal loss, he makes
it his personal mission to vindicate his loss, much to the displeasure of
the C.I.A. The story jumps back and forth between the two assignments,
twisting and turning as the fast paced international game of cat and mouse
bring him closer to the culprit. This book gives a glimpse into the revenge,
retribution and betrayals of backdoor deals made by the C.I.A.
Contains graphic detail and strong language." />
