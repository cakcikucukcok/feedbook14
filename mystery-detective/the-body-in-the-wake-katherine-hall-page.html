  <title>The Body in the Wake - Katherine Hall Page</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Amateur detective and caterer Faith Fairchild is at her Penobscot Bay, Maine cottage preparing for a summer wedding, when she stumbles across . . . another body in this 25th entry in the beloved mystery series.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For the first time in years, Faith Fairchild has time for herself. Her husband Tom is spending days on the other side of the island using a friend&amp;#8217;s enhanced WiFi for a project; their son, Ben, after his first year in college, is studying abroad for the summer; and their daughter Amy is working at the old Laughing Gulls Lodge, now a revamped conference center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faith is looking forward to some projects of her own. Her friend Sophie Maxwell is also spending the summer on Sanpere Island, hoping for distractions from her worries that she isn&amp;#8217;t yet pregnant. And the daughter of Faith&amp;#8217;s good friend Pix Miller is getting married to a wonderful guy . . . with a less-than-wonderful mother. Between keeping Sophie&amp;#8217;s spirits up and Pix&amp;#8217;s blood pressure down, Faith has her hands full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#8217;s before a body with a mysterious tattoo and connections far away from small Sanpere Island appears in the Lily Pond. Once again, Faith will get to the bottom of this strange case&amp;#8212;and whip up a delicious blueberry buckle on the side. &lt;/p&gt;" />
