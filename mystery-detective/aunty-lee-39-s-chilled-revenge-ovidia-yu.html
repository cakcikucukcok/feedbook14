They were forced to dissolve three years earlier after a British expat killed the puppy she&amp;#8217;d adopted, sparking a firestorm of scandal. The expat, Allison Fitzgerald, left Singapore in disgrace, but has returned with an ax to grind (and a lawsuit). At the caf&amp;#233; one afternoon, Cherril receives word that Allison has been found dead in her hotel&amp;#8212;and foul play is suspected. When a veterinarian, who was also involved in the scandal, is found dead, suspicion soon falls on the animal activists. What started with an internet witch hunt has ended in murder&amp;#8212;and in a tightly knit, law-and-order society like Singapore, everyone is on edge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before anyone else gets hurt&amp;#8212;and to save her business&amp;#8212;Aunty Lee must get to the bottom of what really happened three years earlier, and figure out who is to be trusted in this tangled web of scandal and lies.&lt;/p&gt;" />
