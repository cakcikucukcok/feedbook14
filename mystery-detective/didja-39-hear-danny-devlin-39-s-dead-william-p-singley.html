  <title>Didja&#39; Hear? Danny Devlin&#39;s Dead - William P. Singley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Its Ash Wednesday, and all Tommy Palmer wants to do is enjoy his drink at Billy Friscos jazz club and listen to some great American tunes. Carla is on stage, Billys girl, and man, can she sing. The pouring rain outside only makes Tommy, her biggest fan more inclined to stay, until a soaking wet getaway driver tumbles in the front door.
Turns out, Danny Devlin is deadshot at a botched post office robbery. Billy hired an amateur driver who abandoned the crew. Now, Billys in hot water, and Tommy is a witness to his guilt. Due to Billys bad hire, hes ordered to kill the driver plus a prostitute who wont keep her mouth shut about her johns. But Billys no killer. Hes just a dim bulb among the casino glitz. 
However, it looks like Billy will do anything to keep his club and his reputation, even resort to murder. He and Tommy werent meant to be enemies; it just sort of happened, all because of a stormy night and some jazz. All bets are off in Atlantic City as a club owner turns butcher and Tommy decides there are some things a guy just doesnt do." />
