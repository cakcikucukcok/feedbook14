  <title>The Last Illusion - Rhys Bowen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;With sparkling wit, charming characters, and historic detail, multiple  award winner Rhys Bowen brings early-twentieth-century New York City and  the fantastic performers of the time vividly to life in &lt;i&gt;The Last Illusion&lt;/i&gt;.  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Irish immigrant and PI Molly Murphy is thrilled to have a ticket to the theater to see a trio of illusionists that are all the rage. Indeed, headlining is Harry Houdini, the most sensational of them all; he has just returned from entertaining European kings and queens for a brief run on Broadway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But before Houdini can even take the stage, the opening act goes horribly wrong and to the crowd&#39;s shock the illusionist saws into his assistant. In the aftermath, the stunned performer accuses Houdini of tampering with the equipment he keeps under lock and key. And he&#39;s not the only one critical of &quot;The King of Handcuffs.&quot; Risking his life every night, Houdini has raised the stakes to such a perilous level that he&#39;s putting lesser acts out of business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With everyone on edge, Houdini&#39;s wife hires Molly to be part investigator/part bodyguard, but how can she protect a man who literally risks his life every night? And how is she going to uncover whether these masters of illusion are simply up to their tricks or if there truly is something much more treacherous going on.&lt;/p&gt;" />
