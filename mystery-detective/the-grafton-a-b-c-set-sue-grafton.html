A twice-divorced loner with few personal possessions and fewer personal attachments, she&#39;s got a soft spot for underdogs and lost causes. If there&#39;s one thing that makes Kinsey Millhone feel alive, it&#39;s playing on the edge. When her investigation turns up a second corpse, more suspects, and a new reason to kill, Kinsey discovers that the edge is closer--and sharper--than she imagined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;B IS FOR BURGLAR&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although business has been slow lately for P.I. Kinsey Millhone, she&#39;s reluctant to take on the case of locating Beverly Danziger&#39;s sister Elaine Boldt. It&#39;s a small matter that Beverly should be able to handle herself. So why is she enlisting Kinsey&#39;s services? Beverly claims she needs Elaine&#39;s signature on some documents so that she can collect a small inheritance. But the whole affair doesn&#39;t sit well with Kinsey. And if there&#39;s something she&#39;s learned in her line of work, it&#39;s to always follow your instincts... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things take a turn for the worse when a stranger vandalizes the home of one of Elaine&#39;s neighbors and another neighbor turns up murdered. With her reputation and career on the line, Kinsey risks all to find a missing woman and a killer who&#39;s waiting in the shadows to strike again... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;C IS FOR CORPSE&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you go about solving an attempted murder when the victim has lost a good part of his memory? It&#39;s one of Kinsey&#39;s toughest cases yet, but she never backs down from a challenge. Twenty-three-year-old Bobby Callahan is lucky to be alive after a car forced his Porsche over a bridge and into a canyon. The crash left Bobby with a clouded memory. But he can&#39;t shake the feeling it was no random accident and that he&#39;s still in danger... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Kinsey digs deeper into her investigation, she discovers Bobby had a secret worth killing for--and unearthing that secret could send Kinsey to her own early death...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A&quot; Is for Alibi&lt;br&gt;&quot;B&quot; Is for Burglar&lt;br&gt;&quot;C&quot; Is for Corpse&lt;br&gt;&quot;D&quot; Is for Deadbeat&lt;br&gt;&quot;E&quot; Is for Evidence&lt;br&gt;&quot;F&quot; Is for Fugitive&lt;br&gt;&quot;G&quot; Is for Gumshoe&lt;br&gt;&quot;H&quot; Is for Homicide&lt;br&gt;&quot;I&quot; Is for Innocent&lt;br&gt;&quot;J&quot; Is for Judgment&lt;br&gt;&quot;K&quot; Is for Killer&lt;br&gt;&quot;L&quot; is for Lawless&lt;br&gt;&quot;M&quot; Is for Malice&lt;br&gt;&quot;N&quot; Is for Noose&lt;br&gt;&quot;O&quot; Is for Outlaw&lt;br&gt;&quot;P&quot; Is for Peril &lt;br&gt;&quot;Q&quot; Is for Quarry&lt;br&gt;&quot;R&quot; Is for Ricochet &lt;br&gt;&quot;S&quot; Is for Silence &lt;br&gt;&quot;T&quot; Is for Trespass&lt;br&gt;&quot;U&quot; Is for Undertow &lt;br&gt;&quot;V&quot; Is for Vengeance &lt;br&gt;&quot;W&quot; Is for Wasted &lt;br&gt;&quot;X&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
