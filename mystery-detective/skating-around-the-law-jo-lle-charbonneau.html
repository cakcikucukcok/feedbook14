  <title>Skating Around the Law - Joëlle Charbonneau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rebecca Robbins is a woman on a mission---to sell the roller rink she inherited from her mother and get back to Chicago. Fast. However, when she discovers the dead body of the town&#39;s handyman headfirst in a rink toilet, potential buyers are scared off. Now Rebecca is stuck in a small town where her former neighbors think she doesn&#39;t belong, living with her scarily frisky grandfather, Pop, and relying on a police department that&#39;s better at gardening than solving crimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eager to move forward with her life, Rebecca begins investigating the murder herself, reluctantly accepting help from Pop and his extensive social network, which includes a handsome veterinarian and a former circus camel named Elwood. Nevertheless, someone isn&#39;t happy she&#39;s looking into the case, and their threats will have her questioning whether playing sleuth was such a good idea after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joelle Charbonneau&#39;s debut is a sheer delight---a laugh-out-loud mystery with plenty of heart.&lt;/p&gt;" />
