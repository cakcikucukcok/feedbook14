  <title>Lemon Meringue Pie Murder - Joanne Fluke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The residents of Lake Eden, Minnesota, are planning to paint the town red, white, and blue to celebrate the Fourth of July--but the fireworks are already going off at Hannah Swensen&#39;s bake shop, The Cookie Jar.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lemon Meringue Pie Murder&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hannah Swensen thought she&#39;d finally discovered the recipe for a perfect life. But her sometime beau Norman Rhodes tosses a surprise ingredient into the mix when he phones to tell her he&#39;s just bought a house from local drugstore clerk Rhonda Scharf--which he plans to tear down in order to build the dream home he and Hannah designed. It seems the plan has been cooking for quite some time, and Hannah&#39;s shocked. Especially since her ring finger is still very much bare.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The good news is that the soon-to-be-torn-down house is full of antiques--and Norman has given Hannah and her mother first dibs. They uncover some gorgeous old furniture, a patchwork quilt.  .  .and Rhonda Scharf&#39;s dead body. A little more sleuthing turns up the half-eaten remains of a very special dinner for two--and one of The Cookie Jar&#39;s famous lemon meringue pies. Now it&#39;s up to Hannah to turn up the heat--and get busy tracking down clues. Starting in her very own kitchen.  .  .&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Includes nine original cookie and dessert recipes for you to try!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Fun.  .  .frothy.  .  .Enticing recipes for cookies and other treats, presented with helpful procedural hints, are an extra bonus.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;" />
