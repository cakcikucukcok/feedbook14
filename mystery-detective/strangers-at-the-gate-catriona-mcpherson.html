  <title>Strangers at the Gate - Catriona McPherson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;Strangers at the Gate &lt;/i&gt;is one of her best.&quot; - &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Ann Cleeves&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;From Catriona McPherson, Agatha Award-winning author of&lt;i&gt; Quiet Neighbors, &lt;/i&gt;comes &lt;i&gt;Strangers at the Gate&lt;/i&gt;: a twisty, fascinating mystery that asks the question: who do you turn to when everyone&#39;s a stranger and you&#39;ve stopped believing your own eyes? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finnie Doyle and Paddy Lamb are leaving city life in Edinburgh behind them and moving to the little town of Simmerton. Paddy&#39;s been made partner at the law firm in town, and Finnie has snagged a job as a church deacon. Their rented cottage is quaint; their new colleagues are charming, and they can&#39;t believe their luck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But only days after moving into the gate house, Finnie begins to have doubts. She keeps hearing strange sounds, and the thicket of trees make her feel claustrophobic rather than safe. When they witness the bloody aftermath of a brutal murder, it changes everything. They&#39;ve each been keeping secrets about their pasts. And they both know their precious new start won&#39;t survive a scandal. Together, for the best of reasons, they make the worst decision of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that&#39;s only the beginning. The deep, deep valley where Simmerton sits is unlike anywhere Finnie and Paddy have been before. They are not the only ones hiding in its shadow and very soon they&#39;ve lost control of the game they decided to play...&lt;/p&gt;" />
