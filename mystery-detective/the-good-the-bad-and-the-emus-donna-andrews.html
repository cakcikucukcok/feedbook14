  <title>The Good, the Bad, and the Emus - Donna Andrews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Life will never be the same for Meg Langslow after family secrets are revealed, introducing a whole new layer of intrigue in Donna Andrews&#39;s beloved series.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meg&#39;s long-lost paternal grandfather, Dr. Blake, has hired Stanley Denton to find her grandmother Cordelia.  Dr. Blake was reunited with his family when he saw Meg&#39;s picture--she&#39;s a dead ringer for Cordelia--and now Stanley has found a trail to his long-lost love in a small town less than an hour&#39;s drive away.  He convinces Meg to come with him to meet her, but unfortunately, the woman they meet is Cordelia&#39;s cousin--Cordelia died several years ago, and the cousin suspects she was murdered by her long-time neighbor.&lt;br&gt;Stanley and Meg agree to help track down the killer and get justice for Cordelia. Grandfather even has perfect cover--he will come to stage a rescue of the feral emus and ostriches (escaped from an abandoned farm) that infest this town.  He dashes off to organize the rescue--which will, of course, involve most of Meg&#39;s family and friends in Caerphilly. But then, the evil neighbor is murdered, and not only Cordelia&#39;s cousin but also the entire contingent of emu-rescuers, who have had conflict with the neighbor, are suspects.  Only Meg and the cousin--who seems to share a lot of telling traits with Meg--can find the real killer and clear the air in &lt;i&gt;The Good, the Bad, and the Emus&lt;/i&gt;, the newest beverage-spittingly funny installment in this uproarious series from the one-and-only Donna Andrews.&lt;/p&gt;" />
