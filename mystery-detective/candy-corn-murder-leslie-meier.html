  <title>Candy Corn Murder - Leslie Meier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Halloween is coming to Tinker&amp;rsquo;s Cove, Maine, and local reporter Lucy Stone is covering the town&amp;rsquo;s annual Giant Pumpkin Fest for the &lt;/i&gt;Pennysaver&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s the pumpkin-boat regatta, the children&amp;rsquo;s Halloween party, the pumpkin weigh-in&amp;hellip;even a contest where home-built catapults hurl pumpkins at an old Dodge! But not everything goes quite as planned&amp;hellip;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucy&amp;rsquo;s getting very annoyed that her husband Bill and his friend Evan have been working seemingly nonstop on their potentially prize-winning pumpkin catapult. But when the day of the big contest arrives, Evan is nowhere to be found&amp;hellip;until a catapulted pumpkin busts open the trunk of the Dodge. Amid the pumpkin gore is a very deceased Evan, bashed in the head and placed in the trunk by someone long before the contest started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill is on the hook for the Halloween homicide&amp;mdash;he was the last one to see Evan&amp;mdash;so Lucy knows she&amp;rsquo;s got some serious sleuthing to do. The crime&amp;rsquo;s trail seems to always circle back to Country Cousins, the town&amp;rsquo;s once-quaint general store that&amp;rsquo;s now become a big Internet player. Though the store&amp;rsquo;s founder, Old Sam Miller, is long gone, his son Tom and grandson Trey now run the hugely successful company. But whispered rumors say things aren&amp;rsquo;t going well, and Lucy finds that this case may have something to do with an unsolved, decades-old Miller family mystery&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With each new lead pointing her in a different direction, Lucy sees that time is quickly running out. If she wants to spook the real killer, she&amp;rsquo;ll have to step into an old ghost story&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;" />
