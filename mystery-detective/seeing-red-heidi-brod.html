  <title>Seeing Red - Heidi Brod</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The birth of her child, Sky, is a trigger for Seraphine Swift-Whitlock as she is once again haunted by nightmares and flashbacks from the night she was attacked. She thought she was alone, but someone had followed her home. She could still hear his whisper cut through the darkness of the night before the ground rose up and her head hit the pavement and everything faded to black. 
She thought that when she married Harper Swift, she would escape her troubled past; but instead, she is haunted by a deadly secret that wont stay buried and a jigsaw puzzle of feelings and images that threatens to tear her world apart. 
When a college student is murdered and the gruesome crime scene parallels what happened that night on the streets of Boston, its Harper thats put on the case. 
As more bodies surface, Seraphine is thrown back into a labyrinth of darkness, once again fighting for her life. Frightened and desperate, she has to get stronger and learn to fight if shes going to be able to save her beautiful baby girl, Sky, and the only man shes ever loved. 
The characters are all intertwined and pawns in a game as Seraphine tries desperately to unravel the mystery behind the murders before the killer is back to finish what he started." />
