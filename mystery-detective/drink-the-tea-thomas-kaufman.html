  <title>Drink the Tea - Thomas Kaufman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Willis Gidney is a born liar and rip-off artist, an expert at the scam. Growing up without parents or a home, by age twelve he is a successful young man, running his own small empire, until he meets Shadrack Davies. That&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Captain&lt;/i&gt; Shadrack Davies, of the D.C. Police. Davies wants to reform Gidney and becomes his foster father. Though he tries not to, Gidney learns a small amount of ethics from Shad---just enough to bother a kid from the streets for the rest of his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Gidney is a PI, walking those same streets. So it&#39;s no surprise that when his closest friend, jazz saxophonist Steps Jackson, asks Gidney to find his missing daughter, Gidney is compelled to say yes---even though she&#39;s been missing for twenty-five years. He finds a woman who may be the girl&#39;s mother--and within hours she turns up dead. The police accuse Gidney of the murder and throw him in jail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe Gidney should quit while he&#39;s behind. But when his investigation puts him up against a ruthless multinational corporation, a two-faced congressman, and a young woman desperate to conceal her past, Gidney has no time left for second thoughts. In fact, he may have no time left at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas Kaufman is a winner of the PWA Best First Private Eye Novel Competition. His debut novel, &lt;i&gt;Drink the Tea&lt;/i&gt;, which boasts an original PI and an engaging cast of characters, adds a fresh perspective to the genre.&lt;/p&gt;" />
