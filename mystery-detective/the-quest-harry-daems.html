  <title>The Quest - Harry Daems</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The idea that man has the ability to retain in his memory everything that comes before him as he walks through life has been around for many millenniums. The depth of that memory has been the subject of contention for as long as man has had the ability to remember his name from one day to the next. Many are the studies that have been made of this unique ability and they have been listed in three separate categories. The first being; very good memory retention, slowly becoming sketchy as time passes; the second being what we like to call a photographic memory, the ability to remember things for an extended period of time; the third being the one least understood, the one we now call total recall. This group has the ability to remember everything that comes to them and keep it stored in a chronological order forever. The majority of the people living in the world today fall in that first group. A very large number belong in the second group but the people who fit that third group are very few and far between so few that recently when a large University on the West coast attempted to conduct a study on memory retention it took them 6 months to find just one young man who could say he had total recall. In bringing to you the story of The Quest I have attempted to show my readers the many aspects and the very impact of what a total recall memory could mean in the life of one teen age boy. I hope my readers enjoy this book as much as I have had in writing it. Please enjoy." />
