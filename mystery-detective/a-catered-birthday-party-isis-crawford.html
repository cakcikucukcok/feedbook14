  <title>A Catered Birthday Party - Isis Crawford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Little Taste of Heaven catering certainly knows how to feed people. Dogs, however..? When sisters Bernie and Libby sign on to cater Trudy the Pug&#39;s birthday bash, it isn&#39;t just any doggie &#39;do. Trudy&#39;s owner, Annabel Colbert, is one of the richest women in town--and as mascot of the Colbert toy company, Trudy herself is a bona fide celebrity. But when the big day arrives, mere moments after dipping into the wine,  Annabel is shrieking she&#39;s been poisoned--and falling face first into her soup. After two days in a coma, Annabel is dead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  It seems the woman who had everything also had her share of enemies. In fact, Annabel was cheating, blackmailing, or backstabbing most everyone she knew--including Trudy&#39;s trainer and kennel owner. With so many suspects, sniffing out the truth is a risky proposition. Bernie and Libby had better close the oven on this case fast--before they get burned.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Fans of Diane Mott Davidson and Joanne Fluke will enjoy the investigative and culinary antics of the nosey sisters.&quot; &amp;#8211;&lt;i&gt;Library Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Enjoyable and entertaining.&quot; &amp;#8211;&lt;i&gt;Romantic Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Diverting.  .  .gabby.  .  .&quot; &amp;#8211;&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;" />
