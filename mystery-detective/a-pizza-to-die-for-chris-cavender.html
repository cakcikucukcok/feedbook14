  <title>A Pizza To Die For - Chris Cavender</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Though it&#39;s a chilly October in Timber Ridge, North Carolina, Eleanor Swift is warm and cozy in A Slice of Delight, her scrumptious pizzeria. But she feels a shiver when snooty Judson Sizemore blows into town to open an upper-crust competitor. Worse, he has the nerve to get murdered right after he&#39;s seen causing a ruckus in Eleanor&#39;s restaurant. Now she and her saucy sister, Maddie, are the prime suspects. As Eleanor digs for clues to prove their innocence, her own suspect list grows longer than the local soccer team&#39;s pizza order--and life in Timber Ridge heats up like Maddie&#39;s five-alarm Volcano pie.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Includes delicious pizza recipe!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for Chris Cavender and Pepperoni Pizza Can Be Murder&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;The small-town setting, the small-business focus and the relationship between sisters Maddy and Eleanor are all reminiscent of Joanne Fluke&#39;s Hannah Swensen mysteries.&quot; &amp;#8211;&lt;i&gt;Booklist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Cavender is an ace at writing cozies.  His characters are believable, especially the relationship between Eleanor and her sister, and his plots are rock solid.  Sure to appeal to fans of food cozies.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Library Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Scrumptious.  .  .this entertaining series will continue to gain fans with its clever plotting and small-town appeal.&quot; &amp;#8211;&lt;i&gt;RT Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt;" />
