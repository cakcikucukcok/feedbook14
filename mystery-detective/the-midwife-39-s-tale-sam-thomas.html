  <title>The Midwife&#39;s Tale - Sam Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the tradition of Arianna Franklin and C. J. Sansom comes Samuel Thomas&#39;s remarkable debut, &lt;i&gt;The Midwife&#39;s Tale&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;It is 1644, and Parliament&#39;s armies have risen against the King and laid siege to the city of York. Even as the city suffers at the rebels&#39; hands, midwife Bridget Hodgson becomes embroiled in a different sort of rebellion. One of Bridget&#39;s friends, Esther Cooper, has been convicted of murdering her husband and sentenced to be burnt alive. Convinced that her friend is innocent, Bridget sets out to find the real killer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bridget joins forces with Martha Hawkins, a servant who&#39;s far more skilled with a knife than any respectable woman ought to be. To save Esther from the stake, they must dodge rebel artillery, confront a murderous figure from Martha&#39;s past, and capture a brutal killer who will stop at nothing to cover his tracks. The investigation takes Bridget and Martha from the homes of the city&#39;s most powerful families to the alleyways of its poorest neighborhoods. As they delve into the life of Esther&#39;s murdered husband, they discover that his ostentatious Puritanism hid a deeply sinister secret life, and that far too often tyranny and treason go hand in hand.&lt;/p&gt;" />
