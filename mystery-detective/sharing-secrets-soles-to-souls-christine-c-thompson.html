  <title>Sharing Secrets: Soles to Souls - Christine C. Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The story Sharing Secrets: Soles to Souls begins when Amber is five and her family moves to a home on Farmer&#39;s Lane. She marvels at having her own bedroom away from her older sister, Angela. Soon after moving, she begins having a repeating dream. She slowly discovers that her own dream and experiences of other family members lead to a 65-year-old mystery. Though much of the story is true, you will have to read it to decide what is real. Christine C. Thompson, a RN with over 30 years of diverse experiences, had a life-altering episode after a motor vehicle accident in 2002. She had to stop nursing until 2010. Currently, she volunteers as a mentor to MSN students working on their final practicum project. Thompson enjoys listening, learning, and understanding how people handled life&#39;s problems. Writing stories based on someone&#39;s experiences is her way of sharing their knowledge and insight into life&#39;s difficult moments." />
