  <title>The Feast of Wolves - Ben E. Tosho</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Anthony Aja-Daniels was raised with high ideals. He grew up in a poor, rough neighborhood in Southern Sahara, a resources rich third world country. Despite the difficult environment, he carried his morality and honor into adulthood. He had pride in his family and his country, known for its extensive hydrocarbon resources. Then, as time passed, his eyes were opened.&lt;p&gt;
The immense wealth of Anthonys nation only lined the private pockets of the powerful ruling class and their associates. There was little hope for an honest, young man, starting on his own. He still tried. He set out to make a way for himself free of the corruption that surrounded him, but Anthony failed. He realizedpainfullyif you cant beat them, join them.&lt;p&gt;
His noble approach was futile, so he learned that fortune could be found either through crime or by affiliation with persons in power. In a ruthless, calculated manner, Anthony achieves his every dream, but nothing built on burnt bridges can last forever. As he reaches the pinnacle of success, his past transgressions catch up with him, and his fall will be long and hard." />
