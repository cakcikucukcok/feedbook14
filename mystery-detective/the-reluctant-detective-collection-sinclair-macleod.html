  <title>The Reluctant Detective Collection - Sinclair MacLeod</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Book 1 - The Reluctant Detective&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Craig Campbell&amp;#39;s quiet life as an insurance investigator is suddenly disrupted when Ann Kilpatrick asks him to find her son&amp;#39;s killer. At first he doesn&amp;#39;t believe he can help but reluctantly agrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before long he is plunged into a world of corruption, deceit and greed. His journey takes him from the underbelly of Glaswegian society to the rural idyll of a millionaire&amp;#39;s mansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along the way, a death close to home ensures that he has a personal reason to face the dangers and bring the murderer to justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Book 2 - The Good Girl&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Craig Campbell leaves his native city to investigate the disappearance of a young woman from St Andrews. Initially, it appears to be a simple case of a girl escaping to start a new life but it soon becomes apparent that there are ominous undertones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a woman&amp;rsquo;s body is found on a nearby beach the case takes an even darker turn. Craig focuses his attention on the seedy world of escorts and their clients. A pimp with a violent history and a number of witnesses with their own secrets to protect block his investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He finally breaks through the wall of lies and discovers a gruesome truth that leads to a dramatic and explosive climax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Book 3 - The Killer Performer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It should have been Craig Campbell&amp;rsquo;s dream job, working for a rock star who was his boyhood hero. But when the target of his investigation is murdered, Craig is the prime suspect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the police suspicions, The Reluctant Detective is released and begins his own pursuit of the killer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His investigations bring him to the attention of a Glaswegian drug lord with a vested interest in the case. Craig&amp;rsquo;s own safety is threatened and he is ready to walk away but as the body count mounts he feels compelled to continue the hunt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rival drug gangs, jealous musicians, a disturbed rival and a crazed voice from the past are all possible suspects. Craig must find the killer before the finale of their murderous performance brings the curtain down&lt;br /&gt;
on another life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Book 4 - The Island Murder (A Novella)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Craig Campbell is all set for a relaxing weekend break on a Scottish island when he meets a group of motorbike fanatics. They invite him to join them for some drinks in the pub, but the evening is spent with a fractious group of people that contains one very divisive influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When one of them is murdered, Craig begins an investigation that reveals jealousy, greed, scandal and more. Due to a storm the island is isolated from the mainland and with only a special constable for help, he discovers that there is no shortage of suspects. Can he find the killer before the wind and rain relent, and the murderer escapes both the island and justice?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
