  <title>Shattered - Allison Brennan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller Allison Brennan&#39;s two series collide in &lt;i&gt;Shattered,&lt;/i&gt; a powerful, enthralling read about the craving for revenge and the desire for justice.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over a span of twenty years, four boys have been kidnapped from their bedrooms, suffocated, and buried nearby in a shallow grave. Serial killer or coincidence?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s the question investigative reporter Maxine Revere sets out to answer when an old friend begs her to help exonerate his wife, who has been charged with their son&#39;s recent murder. But Max can do little to help because the police and D.A. won&#39;t talk to her--they think they have the right woman. Instead, Max turns her attention to three similar cold cases. If she can solve them, she might be able to help her friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justin Stanton was killed twenty years ago, and his father wants closure--so he is willing to help Max with her investigation on one condition: that she work with his former sister-in-law-- Justin&#39;s aunt, FBI Agent Lucy Kincaid. Trouble is, Max works alone, and she&#39;s livid that her only access to the case files, lead detective and witnesses depends on her partnering with a federal agent on vacation. She wants the career-making story almost as much as the truth--but if she gets this wrong, she could lose everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haunted by Justin&#39;s death for years, Lucy yearns to give her family--and herself--the closure they need. More important, she wants to catch a killer. Lucy finds Max&#39;s theory on all three cases compelling--with Max&#39;s research added to Lucy&#39;s training and experience, Lucy believes they can find the killer so justice can finally be served. But the very private Lucy doesn&#39;t trust the reporter any more than Max trusts her.&lt;br&gt;Max and Lucy must find a way to work together to untangle lies, misinformation, and evidence to develop a profile of the killer. But the biggest question is: why were these boys targeted? As they team up to find out what really happened the night Justin was killed, they make a shocking discovery: Justin&#39;s killer is still out there ... stalking another victim ... and they already may be too late.&lt;/p&gt;" />
