  <title>The Desperate Remedy - Martin Stephen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Thief. Informer. Double-dealer. Pimp. Will Shadwell may not be the most moral of men, but to gentleman spy Henry Gresham he is invaluable. During the reign of King James I a man must know his enemies to survive and Shadwell is one of Gresham&#39;s best sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Shadwell is discovered brutally murdered. And before Gresham is able to establish why, he is summoned by the man he fears most: Robert Cecil, the King&#39;s Machiavellian Chief Secretary. Cecil wants Gresham to investigate Sir Francis Bacon&#39;s private life. When Gresham begins his inquiries, he uncovers a plot so audacious it is scarcely believable: a conspiring clutch of Catholic lords and a trail of gunpowder underneath the Houses of Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the court of King James to the deadly underworld of Jacobean London, Martin Stephen&#39;s superb debut novel is as rich in atmosphere as it is in tension. Historical fiction of the highest order, &lt;i&gt;The Desperate Remedy&lt;/i&gt; is a thrilling tale of courtly machinations.&lt;/p&gt;" />
