Too frail to search for Raphael himself, Elias persuades a contact in the Jewish resistance to send someone in his place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lilya joined the resistance movement to help form a new state, not to waste her time on a fruitless chase across a war-ravaged continent at the request of a frail, most likely delusional, old man. As her comrades make their final preparations for a major operation, a bitter Lilya must accept her orders and embark on her journey to Europe. She is traveling as a member of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, one of the largest aid organizations for Jewish survivors&amp;#8212;many of whom survived the Nazis only to find themselves with no family or home to return to. If Raphael is alive, odds are she will find him among the refugees trapped in displaced persons camps and prevented from immigrating to Palestine by the British.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lilya&amp;#8217;s search leads her from the hushed corridors of London&amp;#8217;s Whitehall, home to the British Secret Intelligence Service, to the haunted, rubble-strewn strasses of Munich and Berlin. Visiting F&amp;#246;hrenwald, an overcrowded and underfunded DP camp, she makes a breakthrough. But Lilya isn&amp;#8217;t the only person pursuing the missing man. Someone has been mirroring her every move&amp;#8212;a dangerous adversary who will go to drastic lengths to find Raphael first.&lt;/p&gt;" />
