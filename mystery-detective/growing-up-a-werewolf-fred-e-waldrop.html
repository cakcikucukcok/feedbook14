God, I hate this, he would mumble to himself, looking up at the ceiling. I know this is just whining, but come on, why me? What is the purpose of me being this? If there were more like me, I could understand, but just me? Why, God, why does it have to hurt so much? Why every time? Maybe just once, just once, God, maybe I could black out or something, please? I could understand if something good came out of this, but come on. This just bites.
