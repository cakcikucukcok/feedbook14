  <title>The Crime Lord&#39;s Daughter - Michael C. Hughes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Det. Ty Connell, Boston PD, takes some well-deserved down time and makes the drive down to NYC. When his cousin Cal is gunned down in a staged West Side bar-room shooting, Connell makes it his mission to exact a very personal kind of revenge. Precinct police advise him that the fingerprints of Johnny O —crime lord John O&#39;Banion— are all over the case. Just not on anything literal or usable. Connell agrees to go under in a town he doesn&#39;t know to burrow into the heart of O&#39;Banion&#39;s empire. Enter wild little rich girl Dani O&#39;Banion —O&#39;Banion&#39;s out-of-control stepdaughter. When she hijacks Connell on the wildest ride of his life to Atlantic City, it launches a most unlikely team to take down the sadistic Johnny O and his crew of hired killers. They end up on the run for their lives in a nail-biting cat-and-mouse chase around Manhattan. What seemed to start with a lot of romantic fireworks becomes more of a protective relationship as Connell dedicates himself to getting Dani through it all alive." />
