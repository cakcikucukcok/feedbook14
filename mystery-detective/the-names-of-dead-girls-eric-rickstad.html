  <title>The Names of Dead Girls - Eric Rickstad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;As I read Eric Rickstad&amp;#8217;s latest,&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;The Names of Dead Girls&lt;/em&gt;, I felt myself constantly wanting to skip ahead -- anxious, desperate, to find out what was going to happen...You&amp;#8217;re in the hands of one of the best in the business, at the very peak of his form. &amp;#8220; -- Michael Harvey, author of&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Brighton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Eric Rickstad delivers another Canaan Crime novel&amp;#160;and features once again detectives Frank Rath and Sonja Test as they track a depraved killer through rural Vermont.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Every murder tells a story. Some stories never end . . . &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a remote northern Vermont town, college student Rachel Rath is being watched. She can feel the stranger&amp;#8217;s eyes on her, relentless and possessive. And she&amp;#8217;s sure the man watching her is the same man who killed her mother and father years ago: Ned Preacher, a serial rapist and murderer who gamed the system to get a light sentence. Now, he&amp;#8217;s free. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detective Frank Rath adopted Rachel, his niece, after the shocking murder of her parents when she was a baby. Ever since, Rath&amp;#8217;s tried to protect her from the true story of her parents&amp;#8217; deaths. But now Preacher is calling Rath to torment him. He&amp;#8217;s threatening Rachel and plotting cruelties for her, of the flesh and of the mind&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;When other girls are found brutally murdered, and a woman goes missing, Rath and Detective Sonja Test must untangle the threads that tie these new crimes and some long-ago nightmares together. Soon they will learn that the truth is more perverse than anyone could guess, rife with secrets, cruel desires, and warped, deadly loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mesmerizing, startling, and intricately plotted, &lt;em&gt;The Names of Dead Girls&lt;/em&gt; builds relentlessly on its spellbinding premise, luring readers into its dark and macabre mystery, right to its shocking end. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
