  <title>Who Killed Lottie Dee????: A Stick LeMaster, PI, Mystery - Carl E. Ring Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="John &quot;Stick&quot; LeMaster is a former Marine turned PI. When Stick is asked to identify the body of his former lover, Lottie Dee, it turns out the body isn&#39;t hers. Suspecting a setup, Stick falsely confirms her identity and returns to his hotel, where he finds Lottie very much alive, with a query that will change the course of Stick&#39;s life: &quot;You in or out?&quot;  Stick is shocked when he learns of Lottie&#39;s true identity: she is spy, as was her recently murdered father, Hayward de Valera. Both were involved with Invictus, a privately funded agency that combats terrorism. Hayward had found four key players providing aid to terrorists, and they need Stick&#39;s PI skills to help them find the quartet of conspirators-a task that will push him to the limit and place him in the sights of mercenaries who&#39;d love to see another US Marine listed as KIA.  In this military thriller, a combat-hardened, street-savvy PI helps a secret organization and its beautiful operative. But can he stop a terrorist attack before it starts?" />
