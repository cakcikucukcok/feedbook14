  <title>Wrath of the Furies - Steven Saylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 88 B.C., it seems as if the entire ancient world is at war. In the west, the Italian states are rebelling against Rome; in the east, Mithridates is marching through and conquering the Roman Asian provinces. Even in the relatively calm Alexandria, a coup has brought a new Pharaoh to power and chaos to the streets. The young Gordianus has been waiting out the chaos in Alexandria, with Bethesda, when he gets a cryptic message from his former tutor and friend, Antipater. Now in Ephesus, as part of Mithridates&#39; entourage, Antipater seems to think that his life is in imminent danger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To rescue him, Gordianus concocts a daring, even foolhardy, scheme to go &quot;behind enemy lines&quot; and bring Antipater to safety. But there are powerful, and deadly forces, at work here, which have their own plans for Gordianus. Not entirely sure whether he&#39;s a player or a pawn, Gordianus must unravel the mystery behind the message if he&#39;s to save himself and the people he holds most dear.&lt;/p&gt;" />
