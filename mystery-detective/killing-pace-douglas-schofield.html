  <title>Killing Pace - Douglas Schofield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Engrossing...It&#39;s a tribute to criminal lawyer Schofield&#39;s persuasive powers that his characters, procedural elements, and atmosphere are convincing enough to keep those pages turning without logic getting in the way.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt; (starred review) on &lt;i&gt;Time of Departure&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Killing Pace&lt;/i&gt;, Douglas Schofield, author of &lt;i&gt;Time of Departure&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Storm Rising, &lt;/i&gt;delivers a heart-pounding tale set in Everglades City, Florida and Sicily, Italy with three important questions: &lt;i&gt;Where am I?... How did I get here?...&lt;/i&gt; and most importantly... &lt;i&gt;Who am I? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been two months since Lisa Green crawled barefoot and bleeding out of a terrible car accident. Her boyfriend Roland has been nursing her back to health under close watch. Lisa has amnesia. They both know that, but only Lisa knows that she hasn&#39;t lost her ability to reason. And reason tells her that she is not Roland&#39;s girlfriend. She is his prisoner. Gradually, Lisa remembers training and skills that she didn&#39;t know she had and is able to make her escape. When a sheriff&#39;s deputy finds her, she tells him she wants to report a missing person: herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What follows is a high-octane international chase, which involves US Border Control, the Sicilian mafia, and a shadowy organization specializing in trafficking infants taken from Syrian refugees and made available for adoption to wealthy American couples. Lisa, whose real name is Laura Pace, must figure out who she can trust and how to stay alive.&lt;/p&gt;" />
