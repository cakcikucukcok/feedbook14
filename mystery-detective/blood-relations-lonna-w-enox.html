  <title>Blood Relations - Lonna W Enox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In a tangled web of mystery and lies, the truth can only be discovered, if the character survives. Often working out a mystery and following&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;the clues can lead you into danger. Unfortunately, the answers you seek may not be the ones you want.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blood Relations&lt;/em&gt; is the second book in this cozy mystery series set in the contemporary Southwest. Not only will readers be intrigued throughout the story, they will enjoy the vivid descriptions of a wild bird refuge, the rugged beauty of the Southwest, along with the visuals of the quaint small towns and their local personalities that the mystery revolves around.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sorrel, a retired investigative journalist, is simply seeking peace after the brutal murder of her husband. She opened a small gift shop out of her home in Saddle Gap, with a close girlfriend, Teri, who handles the daily operations. This allows Sorrel to pursue her passion, photography, especially wildlife photography. She is mentored by her friend, John, also a professional wildlife photographer.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It was on one of John and Sorrel&amp;rsquo;s trips that this mystery starts. Sorrel arrives at the Annual Crane Festival in Socorro, New Mexico as she and John had planned.&amp;nbsp; The morning starts with some amazing views of the wintering birds, as well as a striking sunrise. When John fails to show up, and she is instead greeted by Chris Reed, a Saddle Gap detective, Sorrel fears the worst.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sorrel is determined to figure out what has happened to John. She feels that he is in trouble, and she will not stop searching &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;until she gets some answers. Reed and Sorrel start to investigate John&amp;rsquo;s disappearance.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Along the way they encounter many strange things that, at that point, don&amp;rsquo;t seem to make any sense: a dead body of an unidentified man, strange papers, phone messages from John&amp;rsquo;s attorney, and strange&lt;a name=&quot;_GoBack&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; coded messages left in various places.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sorrel and Reed&amp;rsquo;s search propels them into harm&amp;rsquo;s way, where &amp;nbsp;they find themselves terrorized and in situations that require tenacity, survival skills, and teamwork. &amp;nbsp;When these experiences cause Sorrel to question the people and events in her life, she learns of a deception that will change her life forever.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Sorrel and Reed have a feisty friendship that teeters on becoming more. She dodges his romantic flirtations with her sassy comments, exerting her independence.&amp;nbsp; Undaunted, Detective Reed is more intrigued by her and her secretive past.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Not many books leave me with the urge to immediately re-read them, but &lt;em&gt;Blood Relations &lt;/em&gt;most certainly did. The subtlety of the details and clues written throughout the mystery surfaced only after I finished reading. It is an amazing talent for an author to leave you wanting to re-read her novel. And this well-written and entertaining book made me do so. I then went on to read book one, &lt;em&gt;The Last Dance,&lt;/em&gt; which was awarded the Best Debut Mystery in the CLUE Awards. I was not disappointed. This reviewer is looking forward to reading the next book in this captivating and engaging contemporary Southwestern mystery series by Lonna Enox.&lt;/p&gt;" />
