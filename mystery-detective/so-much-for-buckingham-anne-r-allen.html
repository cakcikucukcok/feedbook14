  <title>So Much For Buckingham - Anne R. Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;It&amp;#39;s a laugh-out-loud mashup of romantic comedy, crime fiction, and satire: Dorothy Parker meets Dorothy L. Sayers. Perennially down-and-out socialite Camilla Randall--a.k.a. &amp;quot;The Manners Doctor&amp;quot;--is a magnet for murder, mayhem and Mr. Wrong, but she always solves the mystery in her quirky, but oh-so-polite way. Usually with more than a little help from her gay best friend, Plantagenet Smith.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This comic novel&amp;mdash;which takes its title from the most famous Shakespearean quote that Shakespeare never wrote&amp;mdash;explores how easy it is to perpetrate a character assassination whether by a great playwright or a gang of online trolls.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this hilarious episode Camilla makes the mistake of responding to an online review of one of her etiquette guides and sets off a chain of events that leads to arson, attempted rape and murder.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Plantagenet, vacationing in England, is accused of the murder and nobody but Camilla&amp;#39;s shady former boyfriend&amp;mdash;fresh from prison&amp;mdash;can save him. Camilla and Plantagenet are caught between rival factions of historical reenactors who are fiercely pro- and anti-Richard III.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And there&amp;#39;s a mysterious cat. Who knows more than he&amp;#39;s letting on&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Although this is #5 in the series, it can be read as a stand-alone&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;Laughs and social commentary abound in this global adventure. Camilla Randall, a down-on-her luck-socialite-turned-etiquette-expert, takes on review cyberbullies while her friend Plantagenet hunts down the ghost of Richard III.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Anne R. Allen has given us a hilarious satire that pokes fun at some dark topics.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Anne Allen is masterful at keeping the plot twisting and turning; and making sure all those details make sense by the end.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;On the surface, it&amp;#39;s a frothy romance-cum-suspense story&amp;hellip;but underneath, it provides a perceptive insight into the mad world of modern publishing and the subculture of Internet lunatics.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Josephine Tey&amp;#39;s Daughter of Time for the 21st Century.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
