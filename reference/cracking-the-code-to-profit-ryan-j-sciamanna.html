  <title>Cracking the Code to Profit - Ryan J. Sciamanna</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do you feel like your lawn-care company is running you?
Does it seem no matter how much money you make you have to turn right around and spend it to keep your doors open?
I know how you feel!  I beat my head against a wall for many years as my lawn care company began to grow until I finally put all the pieces to the puzzle together. My goal is to help you get over the hump much faster than I did and save you a bunch of money along the way.
This book contains every bit of knowledge I gained over the years by learning from my own mistakes.  Each chapter covers various aspects of the business with action steps after each one.
If you believe you can build a successful business, I do too, and I sincerely hope this book helps you reach your goals in business and in life." />
