  <title>Improving on Love and Relationships - Lloyd E. McIlveen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Two books in one cover comprehensive views of love and relationships. 
Relationships are formed best by understanding as much as possible concerning them. Love, with its many splendors and disappointments, can be construed as a detriment or a key to success toward any kind of relationship in romance, business, family, friends, or politics. 
Book 1 adds to an assumed value of love with wide range perception to secure confidence for proceeding with meaningful relationships. It describes what is real and meaningful to what is deceptive and exists as fantasy. 
Book 2 elaborates on origination, different types, significance, deceptions, desires, experiences, communication, possibilities, the future, and guidance of relationships. Its comprehensive and all taken from a lifetime of relationship experiences and study. 
There is probably no better description of love and relationships available at this time than McIlveens display." />
