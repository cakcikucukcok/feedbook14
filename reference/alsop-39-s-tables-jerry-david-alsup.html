  <title>Alsop&#39;s Tables - Jerry David Alsup</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;I just wanted to tell you that I have enjoyed your book &quot;Alsop&#39;s Tables.&quot; It&#39;s great! It has answered some of my questions and also helped to correct some mistakes in our genealogy lines of research. I get to reading and can&#39;t put it down. We certainly would like to receive additional volumes as they are published.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Judd and Kathryn Allsop-Zillah, WA&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a magnificent book. I had no idea your were producing a work of this magnitude. It is beyond my most sanguine expectations.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Benjamin P. Alsop Warthen-Attorney-At-Law-Richmond, Virginia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jerry Alsup is a genealogist without peer. His good nature and devotion to his craft are contagious, one might even say &quot;Inspiring.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The members of this family lineage are going to enjoy reading this author&#39;s book. It is scholarly, thorough, and yet very readable.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Jerry W. Owen, President, Tippah Co., MS Historical and Genealogical Society&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an avid Alsop researcher and history buff, I have found the most valuable sources for information on this family are the books of Jerry Alsup. He provides the family migration patterns, history, marriages, and wonderful stories of people, and he ties them, when appropriate, with historical events. He has the unique knack of narration that makes me feel like I am actually there when family events happened.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--David Alsup-Long Beach, CA&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
