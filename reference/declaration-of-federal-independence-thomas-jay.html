  <title>Declaration of Federal Independence - Thomas Jay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Founding Fathers declared independence from Tyranny. With no experience and no example, they laid the foundation with a Constitution- perfectly. They counted on one thing that was true then, but no longer: politicians would believe in the idea, and follow it. The establishment no longer does. They work around it or ignore it. There is no accountability other than elections. Power is centered with Congress instead of with the People. This is a new declaration of We the People to the new establishment tyranny - the Federal Government; it is our only option for change. They can&#39;t fix it - they are the problem. This is our reset. It presents our grievances and the Constitutional Language to fix them. It is a New declaration. It is the step that the Founding Fathers gave Us, and it is time: &quot;That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it.&quot; Alter it with a declaration of Freedom from the new Tyranny. Declare your freedom or lose it" />
