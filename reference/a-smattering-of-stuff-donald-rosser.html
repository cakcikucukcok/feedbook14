  <title>A Smattering of Stuff - Donald Rosser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Welcome to A SMATTERING OF STUFF, a collection of columns I have written in recent years. If youre interested in such things as Money, History, Science or Show Business, youll find Rosser columns to your liking. But, first, Ill introduce myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I was born in 1927, when Calvin Coolidge presided, and slept in diapers while Lindbergh flew the Atlantic. I grew up in Brooklyn, on a penny-a-day allowance, during the Depression., and I fondly remember my public schooling at P.S. 217 and the Brooklyn Technical High School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In 1944, I enlisted in the Army Air Force and plotted meteorological charts in the Weather Service. On the GI Bill, I attended Alfred University, where I ran on the track and cross-country teams and met wife Helen. My career was in journalism and education, on the Pierre, S.D., Capital Journal, the Rapid City Journal, and the Atlantic City Press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I taught senior English at Atlantic City High School until the New Jersey Eduation Assn. recruited me as its press officer/house writer. I have lived in South Jersey since 1954 in the towns of Brigantine, Willingboro, Moorestown, and Mount Laurel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; After moving to a retirement development in 2007, I was asked to write for the communitys newsletter, THE VILLAGER. This collection of columns is the result. Topics include matters of general interest back to the Stone Age. Some address my experiences in events like the Depression, Pearl Harbor Day. and World War 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Duplicate bridge and cycling are my main recreational activities. I have toured Europe many times with the Lafayette Riders and, after I qualified for the 75-and-above category, I won five gold medals in the annual New Jersey state time trial. My bridge rank is Life Master. Now I do crossword puzzles and nap a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Finally, its your turn  read on. I trust that my essays will not put YOU to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
