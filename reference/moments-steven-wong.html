  <title>Moments - Steven Wong</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Moments tells the story of the heart-wrenching and unforgettable events that happened in author Steven Wongs life over the past decade. As part of his philosophy of giving back to society, he has compiled the details of his journey from a seemingly healthy life into the throes of a life-threatening disease. The events he discusses in Moments are based upon his real-life experiences as a patient. When he finally sought a second opinion after months of what appeared to influenza, his life was forever changed by the outcome of the doctors findings.
His story reveals the journey and challenges that he experienced while battling nasopharyngeal carcinoma, commonly known as cancer of the throat. He recounts errors in judgment, missteps that could be avoided, oversights, and consequences that he had to endure as a patient. He candidly and poignantly discusses the effect his disease had on his friendships. In fact, he categorized his friendships into three groups: true friends, friends, and dubious friends. The hurt he experienced when he realised that many of his friends could not handle his illness was deep. 
His perseverance and determination, along with the love of family and friends, made this unexpected journey manageable, bearable, and memorable. Now he seeks to inspire and motivate others to move forward courageously when faced with challenging circumstances during their lifes journeys." />
