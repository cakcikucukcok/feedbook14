  <title>The Preservationist&#39;s Guide to Technological Change and the American Home 1600-1900 - Lee Perry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Book Description: 
This work is an exploration of American building technologies as they evolved during the period between colonial times and nineteen hundred. The manuscript consists of six chapters and an historical glossary of building construction related terms. The chapters cover technological developments in house framing, masonry materials and techniques, plumbing, heating, lighting, and architectural details and finishes. The glossary of terms follows the meanings of building terminology as it developed over the course of three centuries.
The intent of this work is to create a detailed, if not utterly comprehensive, body of information tracing the way in which our homes changed as they mirrored the impact of technological change on all aspects of the American condition. We are and have been from the start, a nation of ardent techno junkies. The technological evolution of our homes offers a useful and clear metaphor through which to trace the evolution of our technological development and related national character, through primary focus on the concrete and practical aspects of the technologies of residential architecture.
Author Bio: 
Lee comes from a New England background and has both a lifetime of building experience with historic structures and a formal advanced education in the field of historic preservation. For the past ten years he has worked as a project manager on a variety of high profile museum projects." />
